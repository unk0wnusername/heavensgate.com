      What do you say to someone who saved your life?  How do  you
acknowledge them or thank them?  What do you say about their enemies -
your former mentors/seeming nurturers?  This is my attempt.<p>

      Today's civilization is strikingly like abused children growing
up ignorant of their abuse, accepting of the lies and conditioning fed
them, knowing nothing else.  Some come from worse "immediate-families"
(governments/locales/societies) than others, but the "extended-family"
is still the same - all cling to the same basic mammalian values and
ways.  All are abused.  Imagine how hard it must be for each abused
child to recognize help from someone outside the "family," much less
grab hold of it.  The child has been programmed (brainwashed) to
automatically reject that help and cling to what is familiar - however
abusive and destructive it has become, somehow justifying it as good
or right.  How do you get through to them?<p>

      After centuries of abuse, the human genetic package no longer
resembles the original design.  Legends of space travelers or tales of
a religious nature are about the only remnants left in its programming
of  past associations of beings from another "family."  The very  idea
that those "myths" or prophecies could have any practical basis in
this world might be fun to think about, but if you really faced
reality, you'd come to your senses.  A heavenly kingdom of God?  UFO
crashes in the desert?  Yeah, right!  Right?<p>

     For many 20th Century bodies, myth suddenly became reality in the
Fall of '75.  After 2 to 3 years of slowly losing its motivation to
succeed in the world, wanting something more and finding no
satisfaction even in offbeat circles, the vehicle (body) that had been
prepped for my use heard "mere" words over a radio - words that would
change its existence forever.  It would be months before it would meet
the source of those words - two beings, called Ti and Do.  Though it
was mindful of ancient warnings of caution and the educated
admonitions of its peers, there was a familiarity with what was being
said that went straight to my very being.  I was amazed that others
didn't react the same way.  It would be years before I would finally
understand and accept the reality of<strong>:</strong> "No one is able to come to Me
unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him." [John  6:44].
But even that is no guarantee of success.  It takes hard work<strong>;</strong> it
takes bonding with the ones of that family sent here for you - in this
case, Ti and Do.  Thousands may have recognized the opportunity, but
ultimately only a few dozen endured the practical application of
weaning from the human family (kingdom), fended off the
attacks/allures of alien outcasts and other external influences, and
ultimately received adoption by the true Caretakers of the garden -
members of a non-mammalian family.  This transition goes beyond just
dropping all human vices (coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, etc.),
mammalian behavior (sexuality, socializing, etc.), even to how one
thinks - learning to relinquish self-trust and working instead as an
active part of the whole.  All through the transition, Ti and Do
worked harder than we did, made sacrifices, put up with indignities,
suffered mental anguish, solely out of their compassion and
understanding of what we children were up against.  No mother's
travail could have been worse.  They didn't have to do that, but they
chose to because of who they are.  It is easy to see how humans
mythicized Ti and Do's previous contacts with this civilization - they
are beyond anything humans could imagine.  There is no way any of us
would have gotten through it without them.  I know.<p>

      It has been difficult for humans through the Ages to discern
who's who of the advanced beings who circulate in the heavens - to
them all were gods.  Over time, myth and legend blurred even further
the questions of what/who is God, what is man's purpose, how is it
that he even exists?  Religions have tried to soothe the conflict such
issues brought to the common man and reconcile the gap between man and
God.  Governments under that same influence have tried to govern,
becoming a religion in and of themselves as they legislate morality
"in the interest of the common good."  They tried to cope with stimuli
beyond their control - stimuli generated by different outcast aliens
(ancient "gods") in pursuit of their own diverse agendas - stimuli
that abused humans, buffeting them around like "feathers in the
breeze" with no real understanding of their purpose for being.  For
this same reason, Jesus called the religious leaders of His time "Sons
of Satan" [John 8:44] - not because they were evil, but because they
were <em>unwitting</em> pawns of those same outcast aliens, and they were also
influencing others in the same way.  They lacked discernment.  They
had too much pride and self-concern - characteristics that run strong
among the various alien groups they unknowingly look to.  Similarly,
each time a government official insists some culture adopt his brand
of government, justifying its own atrocities and corruption, or each
time  an evangelist lays hands on a pile of letters  sent  by the
faithful to be blessed, in expectation of wealth or success, that
abuse spreads.  Thus, the abused child often  becomes the abuser,
perpetuating and deepening the cycle - a cycle that can only be broken
by those beyond the human family.<p>

     I've spent over 20 Earth years in a human body in the presence of
two Older Members of the family rightfully called God.  I've had the
opportunity to see what makes them happy or sad, how they deal with
seemingly impossible situations, how they maintain self-dignity and
continue to humble and question themselves when it would be easy to
pass blame to another.  I can tell you first hand, Ti and Do brought
us to this training ground not for any honor, nor even just for our
sake, but also out of compassion for you.  They would stay here until
the flesh vehicles they are wearing literally fell apart if they
thought it would help (and indeed Ti did).  And even though the time
allotted for the completion of our task here has run out, until the
garden is recycled, you still have time to "file for adoption."  If
you study and try to apply what they have taught, even if you don't
leave when we do, even if you lose your flesh body while you are
trying  to  grow  closer to the Level Above Human,  you  will  not  be
abandoned.  I know that this paper leaves a lot unsaid<strong>;</strong>
I hope that you can find such things as "<em>'95 Statement by an E.T.
Presently Incarnate</em>" to clarify the overall picture.  Cling to, adhere
to, and trust in them - they are your only way out of here.  Good
luck.<p>
