<font size="+6">W</font>e hope you won't misunderstand our use of these Bible quotes.
Though most people think of these records as religious, they are
for the most part, in spite of their many inaccuracies, the primary
historical record we have of periods when the Next Level was
relating to man.  A great percentage of the materials have been
corrupted by mistranslations and councils of so-called scholars.
It seems miraculous that the formula for transition from the
human kingdom to the Level Above Human has been preserved in
Jesus' requirements for discipleship.  We are including a number
of these examples.  We chose to use <em>The Amplified
Bible</em> (translation), with a few exceptions, for its clarity.<p>
<dt>The following are explanatory excerpts taken from the "Preface" and the
"Introduction" to <em>The Amplified Bible</em><strong>:</strong> the
purpose of <em>The Amplified Bible</em>
<blockquote><em>is to reveal...any
     other clarifying meanings that may be concealed by the
     traditional translation method.  The use of amplification
     merely helps the reader comprehend what the Hebrew and
     Greek listener instinctively understood (as a matter
     of course).
<p>
     Parentheses (   ) signify additional phases of meaning
     included in the original word, phrase, or clause of the
     original language.
<p>
     Brackets [   ] contain justified clarified words or
     comments not actually expressed in the immediate
     original text.</p></p></em></blockquote>
