<dd><h4> of the FORMULA for entering</h4>
<ul><dl>
<dt><strong><font size="+1">THE EVOLUTIONARY KINGDOM LEVEL ABOVE HUMAN</font></strong>
<dd>-- the <em>only real</em> Heaven
<dd>-- a <em>physical</em> Kingdom Level that <em>cannot</em> be entered "after you die"
<dd>-- one that exists in the literal heavens, with its own unique
biological "containers" or bodies, and modes of travel - spacecrafts or "UFOs"

<dd><li>Entering it requires "midwifing" by an Older Member from that
Kingdom who is incarnate (in the human kingdom) to take you through that
"birthing."

<dd><li>That birthing requires: the shedding of all human-mammalian
behavior, such as sexuality (all forms); ties (to family, human
relationships, possessions, and responsibilities); addictions (of all
types); habits; and self-concerns.  </li></dd></li></dd></dd></dd></dd></dt></dl>
<li>This FORMULA was <em>first</em> offered to this civilization 2000 years ago, by
one Older Member from that Kingdom Level (who incarnated into a body that
was 29-30 years old).

<li>It was offered a <em>second</em> time in 1975/76 by two Older Members from that
same Kingdom (who incarnated when the bodies that were "picked" and
"prepped" for them were in their early 40's).

<li>It is <em>now</em> being offered, for the last time in this civilization, by
those students (from the 1975/76 "yield") who have been taken through
their "birthing" and are now representatives of that Kingdom Level.

<li>The Representative 2000 years ago, the two Representatives who came
this time, and their students (the "yield") all <em>came</em> and <em>will
leave</em> in spacecrafts or "clouds of light."</li></li></li></li></ul><p>
