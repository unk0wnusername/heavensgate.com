Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 2
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr/>

Welcome to Beyond Human - The Last Call. This is our second
session. I'm going to assume that you've watched our first session.
After that session, we got our heads together, watched the session,
and tried to look at it from your point of view and determine
where the big gaps were, and we've pretty much designed today's
session about or around those gaps - the questions that might
have come into your head then, or since watching yesterday's session.
So, I'm going to look primarily to these students to help me
with those questions. They've listed them, and we're just going
to cover them one right after the other. Are you going to help
me with this list of questions better than you did yesterday?
(laughs)
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, we're certainly going to try.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Let's get started. What was the first question on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> The first one that we have written down here is<strong>:</strong> as far
as overcoming, how was Jesus' mission different from Ti and Do's?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I know I could say this again and again, but that's a good
question. I get uncomfortable comparing Jesus' mission to Ti
and Do's mission because I know how <em>precious</em> Jesus' mission
is in our eyes as well as in much of the public's eyes, and I
know how offensive it could be to compare Jesus' mission with
Ti and Do, whom most people have never heard of. But we have
to address the question. Jesus, and Ti and Do, both came with
the information that<strong>:</strong> "the end of the Age is approaching,
and if you're going to get from the human kingdom into our Heavenly
Father's Kingdom, then you're going to have to overcome the world.
You're going to have to leave everything and come and follow
me. And as a 'Rep,' I can be used as an instrument of that Kingdom
to help you get into that Kingdom after you leave your humanness
behind." That much is common.
<p>
One major feature is very different<strong>:</strong> It's certainly on the record
that Jesus' mission was designed, <em>before</em> He came, that
He would represent the <em>purity </em>that was required to enter
the Kingdom of Heaven. In other words, this is the reason why
humans say again and again, "I can never be like Him because
He's so pure. He never sinned. He was spotless. He went through
His whole life without sin." Well, that appears to have
been the design. Not that I'm saying that He should have been
sinful, for He had overcome the world. Prior to that incarnation,
He had overcome the world. So, He did not need to get back into
the world, even though He did need to awaken to recognize that
He had come from the Kingdom of Heaven and what His mission was.
That awakening was still difficult and painful and, I'm sure,
trying for Him, because He knew how blasphemous it was going to
sound the minute He began to express it.
<p>
In Ti and Do's case, it's almost 180 degrees in another direction.
Ti and Do came, and first of all, our awakening was much later
in the lifetime than Jesus', because Ti and Do met in their early
forties and were as asleep as you can be at that time. But even
a more major difference was that both of us were very much into
humanness. This was the design. It was designed this way in
the Kingdom of Heaven before we came in, because Satan had grasped
onto what Jesus' M.O. had been. And the way that he could keep
humans from thinking about their overcoming was to picture Jesus
as someone that was so perfect that, since He died on the cross,
He could redeem you if you just love Him and believe that He existed
and accept Him as your Savior. That's the way he could keep you
from relating to the fact that you would have to <em>do</em> what
Jesus said and overcome the world also, as He did. Since Lucifer,
or Satan, had done such a good job of having people relate to
that perfection M.O., or that purity M.O. of Jesus' mission, the
Next Level then said, or the Kingdom of Heaven then said, "Well,
<em>this </em>time when we send Representatives we're going to do
just the opposite. We're going to send them and let them get
<em>completely</em> into the world to remind humans that <em>you
can be completely into the world and get out of the world.</em>"
<p>
I told you yesterday that when I met Ti, and even <em>before</em>
I met Ti - I would say probably a year before I met Ti - that
my life began to just fall apart. But the important thing is
that it's common. As we discussed some yesterday, a <em>symptom</em>
of a soul awakening to the point where it jives with its previous
incarnation, a symptom that accompanies that awakening, seems
to be a life kind of falling apart. Some souls, if they haven't
overcome much in the way of human lessons, then their awakening
certainly would not be anything traumatic. If they do not overcome
their attachments, then nothing traumatic is happening, because
they're not dropping those attachments at the point of their awakening
where they would jive with a previous incarnation. I know I'm
going <em>way</em> beyond the question that you brought up about
the hole in yesterday's talk. I could go on with this one for
the rest of this hour. Let's go to our next question.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> How did Ti's mission differ from Do's mission, since
Ti left and returned to the Kingdom of Heaven before Do?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well (laughs), here we go again. That's an interesting question,
too. That was a very tough one for me. And I think it was a
tough one for Ti, because it came as such a surprise. I don't
know why, but Ti and I thought that - we just <em>knew</em>, it
seemed - that we would both be here for the full duration
of the task. It didn't occur to us that one might leave prior
to the other one leaving. Let's see, Ti has been gone almost
7 years - it will be 7 years this spring or this summer. 
When Ti began to see the signs of leaving her vehicle, she, I
think, was puzzled, and I certainly was puzzled. But I must take
this opportunity to relate to you that it didn't change her position
at all regarding her devotion to her Heavenly Father and to this
task. She didn't want to relate to the human connection at all,
or to the flesh body's connection to the world. She remained
perfectly steadfast to the mission that she was involved in, and
in her partnership with me in that mission, and remained true
to it every second. She didn't say, "What's the Next Level
doing here? What's happening here"? Her only thought was
to me, "I'm glad that you don't have to experience what I am going through."
And the irony was that I was saying, "I wish I could be going in your place."
That was no big, wonderful thing for me to say. It was because
I feared being left with the responsibility of the mission with
my partner being gone. And I did, I seriously feared it.
<p>
I have to stop here and address another question. Because you
could say, "What caused Ti to leave her vehicle? What was
used as the instrument of her leaving when she did"? And
it was that the vehicle broke down. Humans would say that the
vehicle died. How can we say that she "left her vehicle"?
Because I know and understand Ti, and I understand Ti's relationship
with our Heavenly Father, I know that she had within her power,
or within her authority, if she chose to use it, she could have
made the choice of when she left her vehicle or when she didn't.
You can say, "Oh that's baloney." And that's fine
if you want to say it. I know Ti. You don't know Ti. These
students, they know Ti. But I know that Ti's thinking was to
her Father, "I didn't expect this - that I would be leaving
my vehicle at this time - but if that's what you have in mind
for me, and if that's what you have in mind for Do, and for the
class, then that's what we want."
<p>
I could see in Ti's eyes, I could read her soul, I could see
mixed feelings. I could see part of her that was joyful in knowing
that soon she would be out of the human kingdom. That portion
of her mind that was here could be back in a vehicle that was
appropriate for the Kingdom of Heaven and back in a closer, realistic,
physical relationship with her Heavenly Father. And that couldn't
help but be joyful. But she didn't want to think about that
because she didn't want to shirk her responsibility. She was still
"task conscious." She was still concerned with, "What
kind of hardship is this going to play for Do? What kind of pressure
is this going to put on him and on the classroom? Are students
going to be lost because I'm leaving my vehicle? Are they going
to slip into thinking, 'Well, Ti's died, and here's Do. So, this
makes all this fall apart?'" And yet I know that she knew
that if the students <em>knew</em> any of the truth that had been
given to us, and that we shared an understanding of, that they
would not look at it from that point of view. If they were challenged
by that, then it was good that they be challenged in that way.
If that was the point of their falling away, then there needed
to be a point of their falling away. They were going to be challenged
sooner or later with some test, because that's the name of growth
- it's our being confronted with tests that causes us to either
go forward, closer to our Heavenly Father, closer to the Kingdom
of Heaven, or we are challenged with saying, "I don't know.
Maybe I'm coming to my senses. I'll go recover my humanness
if I can."
<p>
Back to your question. When Ti left her vehicle and returned,
what it meant to me, even though it still breaks my heart to recall
the experience, it very swiftly and very solidly put me on firmer
ground in relationship to my Heavenly Father. It put me in a
better relationship with Ti than I had before she left her vehicle.
I know that Ti is still to this day my <em>primary</em> if not
my <em>total</em> link with our Heavenly Father, the Heavenly Father
that we shared in that task. I believe that we still share to
this day the same Heavenly Father. But also in my awareness is
that Ti is an older soul - a more experienced soul, has been
given more knowledge, knows more, can make choices more quickly
and more readily in the judgment that she has learned from our
Father. This has done tremendous things for me to find myself,
wow! - alone, as far as physically alone. My partner has
left her physical body. It feels so funny for me to say "her"
when I speak of Ti, even though she was in a body that had been
a female. I say "had been" because she had certainly
overcome any gender consciousness before going back to our Father's
Kingdom.
<p>
I could go on and on, but it meant a tremendous growth opportunity
for me and for the class. It tested me. It tested the class.
And we're all 10 feet taller because of it. It put me in a relationship
now, with Ti, similar to the relationship that Ti had with our
Heavenly Father before Ti left her vehicle. If we ever came down
to question, in our working as a partnership, as to who might
have the last word, it was never fought over or debated. But
it became evident after a period of time in <em>my</em> searching,
not because Ti imposed it, but in my searching I recognized that
Ti <em>knew </em>more. Therefore, she had a better, trusting relationship
with her Heavenly Father. She could recognize His voice more
readily than I. Rather than, "Let's see, does that mean
this"? or "Do we need to try that"? She didn't
need to do all the seeking and searching because the voice was
clearer, the control of the "frequency," if you want
to put it in that illustration, was clear. Had she not left her
vehicle and put me in the position that I am now in, I wouldn't
have this opportunity to really work, and work hard, on my connection
with that mind.
<p>
When the class and my relationship with the class are confronted
with questions and decisions that need to be made, I could easily
say, "Oh, what am I going to do in this situation"?
or "We'll do this or we'll do that." And the test always
is, do I say, "Ti, what would you have us do? <em>Your</em>
will, not mine, not ours." And if the class, and if I, can
always connect with our Father's Kingdom through the link that
we have, the <em>closest Older Member</em> that we have, that link
is the assurance. Now I know that even if Ti got called on another
task for a period of time while I'm in this position, I know that
Ti's Heavenly Father, who also, as I said, is my Heavenly Father,
even though Ti is older, I know that my <em>best</em> funneling
of my asking, my <em>safest</em> funneling is to continue to ask
Ti. The thing that could get me completely off the track is if
I said, "Oh Father so and so" instead of going through
Ti. I have learned from my experience that I must continue to
ask my partner, "Ti, what do we do in this situation"?
I don't always get an answer right away (sometimes I get no answer
at all - it means the question isn't worth answering - or
I might keep looking for what was wrong with that question), but
I know it's my assurance of staying on track. So, to finish what
I started to say, even if Ti were put on another task, I know
that our Father would station someone, saying, "If Do says,
'Ti, what do we do?', that's when you answer - only then.
If he says, 'Well, Father, what do we do?', don't answer, because
he's going to get off track."
<p>
Now, boy! that opens another whole big question. Why would I
address something to Ti instead of to my Heavenly Father? Ti
<em>is my Older Member.</em> Ti is in the succession of relationship.
In a sense, Ti is my Heavenly Father, even though I still relate
to the Older Member that dealt with Ti and Do as a partnership.
It's not that I'm elevating some human named Ti. That's just
an identification that directs my asking to my Older Member and
it is my <em>safeguard</em> for staying on the right track. I know
how Luci can dive in and answer my call when I direct it to my
"Heavenly Father," and I can feel that it's off track.
Luci is not permitted to answer the call that I direct to Ti.
That's <em>protected</em> for my sake and for the sake of my students.
I know that's hard to understand, when you know how right it
is for you to relate to your Heavenly Father.
<p>
Listen, I have to jump to another question now that I know is
on their list, because this forces me into the question of what
is meant when people say, "Do you have a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ"? The only ones who really had a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ are the ones who were <em>physically
present</em> with Him, and <em>looked</em> to Him, and <em>believed</em>
Him. Now, I have to enlarge that picture and say it also means
that <em>those souls</em>, after they left those vehicles in the
time that they were with Jesus, they continued to have - as long
as they had not turned from Him - and they continue to have a
personal relationship with that same Soul [Jesus], unless the
Kingdom of Heaven, or our Father, has put someone else in that
position. And I'm certainly not suggesting that anything has
happened in that regard in our presence here, or our assignment
here. But I have to make the point, when Jesus said, "...if
you do this in My name," He was talking about those who knew
Him and believed Him. They were disciples. They were devoted.
They were going to the Kingdom of Heaven via the "ductwork"
of the one called Jesus. He was their "Rep." They
accepted Him as their Rep and they were calling His name. In
that same way, I have to at <em>this</em> time call Ti's name. 
I don't know, Ti could have been a return of that soul that was
Jesus. It doesn't matter to me. You could say, "Oh, but
it <em>should</em> matter." Then you don't know the knowledge,
you don't know Jesus, you don't know my Heavenly Father, or you
would know the knowledge that is <em>given</em> to me. Not because
of anything that I deserve, but by <em>Their choice. </em>They,
the chain of command in the Kingdom of Heaven, give me the knowledge
as They gave the knowledge to Ti and Do, as they give it now to
Ti, and as Ti gives it to me. And it is the <em>same knowledge
</em>that was in Jesus. It is from the same Family, from the same
Household. It comes down the same trunk and goes out the same
vines. If you really knew Him or know Him today, you will know
that we are of that same Family, that our information does not
differ one iota, that it is the same Truth, just different vehicles,
different Reps.
<p>
Now the position is a little different - and here's another question
on your list - because we're at the end of the Age, and Jesus
kept warning about the importance of the end of the Age. This
is a big time here at the end of the Age. What is the end of
the Age? Well, you know the hippies and the New Agers speak of
it as when Aquarius is around the corner or "here we are
at the year 2000 and this is the end of the Age." And it
<em>is</em> the end of the Age. The end of the Age is likened to
when the Kingdom of Heaven, and I must say in the same breath,
not only the Kingdom of Heaven, but it's when the <em>garden</em>
is <em>harvested</em> at the end of a civilization. How is a garden
harvested? A garden is harvested by the ones who have a relationship
to the garden - be it from our Father's House, or be it from those
that are off the strain, off the vine of <em>misinformation</em>
and connected with the one that we refer to as Lucifer or Satan,
though they certainly don't know that. From their point of view,
they're connected with the "Son of Light," the "Angel
of Light," the "truth." They believe that truth.
It has some different earmarks as we discussed. It has some
earmarks of "Ye are gods," "ye are the cosmic
consciousness," the "universal mind." Those earmarks
are not found in our Father's House. Our Father's House has earmarks
of "Creator," "Father," "Son"
- the way the pipeline works down in relationship from the Kingdom
of Heaven to the human kingdom.
<p>
Well, back to "here we are at the end of the Age" and
it's harvest time. Harvest time means that it's time for the
garden to be spaded up. It's time for a recycling of souls. 
It's time for some to "graduate." It's time for some
to be "put on ice." It's time! I don't know all of
the things that are going to happen at the end of the Age because
that harvesting task is not one that I am participating in. I
suppose that I would say that Ti's job and Do's job or our partnership
task is "tooting that trumpet," or making this sound
right here at the end that says, "Last call - if you
want to go beyond human, if you want to not have this Age that
we've been in here for 6000 years go down the drain, if you're
connected, if you have received a gift that connects you with
this truth, with our Heavenly Father, with the family of the Creator,
then you have an opportunity to <em>do it</em>, to overcome the
world, to move into that Kingdom permanently, not needing to return
to the human condition."
<p>
I'm afraid I have to go to another one of your questions and
this one is<strong>:</strong> Where does this idea of being "saved"
get in there? Jesus said, 'If you <em>believe</em> who I am, and
you believe what I'm saying, and if you stay connected with Me,
if you do things through My Name, then you'll be saved.' And
it's true. That doesn't mean that you have finished your overcoming.
It means that you are not "wasted." Being "saved"
means that you are not wasted. It also means that you are saved
from <em>not</em> going with the crowd that's going with misinformation,
that's going with all that is not true. Now,<em> I</em> do not
know and I'm glad that I don't know who is saved and who isn't,
but if I <em>should</em> know, then I guess <em>then</em> I will know.
I only know what has been <em>given</em> to me. And it's given
to me on their time table, not when I want to know it. All I
know is what is given to me to know. And even when I receive
what I think that they've given to me and I think I know it, as
soon as they give me something else, I recognize that what I know
was partially out of balance or out of sync. The <em>next </em>thing
they give me makes me re-examine it and update it and suddenly
I see what I thought I knew before is not that accurate, that
the new perception is much more accurate. So, I think I know
that, until I receive something else, and then I realize that
that's the <em>process</em> of growth.
<p>
But here we are at the end of the Age. In a sense, when Jesus
said you can be saved, it was not the end of the Age, though He
knew it was approaching, and He knew from His point of view it
could be right around the corner. He told them the signs of what
the end of the Age would be, and according to all the people you
listen to and all the prophecy that's going around, everybody
says, "This is it. This is the end of the Age. We don't
know exactly the hour and the minute." Unfortunately, the
exact hour or the minute doesn't really matter that much. It
<strong>is </strong>the end of the Age. What matters is where are <em>you</em>
at the time of the spading, at the time of the harvest? What
happens to you? Have you become something that's so worthless
that our Father's House has no need of you, and He just recycles
you as a part of His recycling environmental control for a possible
new Age? Now, I don't mean "New Age" new Age. I mean
<em>His</em> new Age. If He wants to use this garden as a hothouse
again, then He can take the waste, including "soul"
waste, including "vehicle" waste, and He can recycle
it into a useful product for a garden to be planted again.
<p>
So, one question is<strong>:</strong> have I become something that's just going
to be recycled as waste at the end of the Age? Or, might I become
something that can actually complete my overcoming under the helpful
guiding hand of "Reps" whose task is <em>overcoming</em>.
I can help you overcome this world. I'll give you lessons. 
I'll be used as the object of lessons and put you to tests that
I don't mean to put you to tests for. I don't even like to put
you to tests, but I'm willing to put you to tests.
<p>
Ever since Ti and I have been working with the class, we put
themselves and ourselves to tests constantly. Or let me say it
this way<strong>:</strong> The Kingdom of Heaven puts us to these tests as we
ask for Their will not ours. We don't ever design tests for students
or for ourselves. They are designed for us and given to us. 
They always shock us. They're always a surprise - even to
this day. Even though we've learned - "Uh oh, that's
a test." We've gotten that far - recognizing "here
comes a test." Okay, so one is<strong>:</strong> I can become "waste"
at the end of the Age. One is<strong>:</strong> I can overcome the world with
the help of those who have overcome the world. I expressed to
you in the last session that I've gotten instruction that I can
say to you that these students have reached a point in their overcoming
that they can survive as beginners in the Kingdom of Heaven and
not need to return to the human condition. In other words, that
point of their overcoming is <em>sufficient</em> that they can move
into the Kingdom of Heaven and take a physical vehicle that belongs
to the Kingdom of Heaven. Wow! That's a big picture isn't it.
Because that physical vehicle in our Father's House doesn't <em>need</em>
to be reproductive. It's neither male nor female. It's got no
gender, it has no race relationship, it has no allegiance to anything
of a "plant." It has allegiance only to its trunk and
vines, and Representatives right down the chain of command, or
the step-wise relationship, or link.
<p>
What if I'm not waste, but I haven't finished my overcoming,
and I believe that what you're saying is the truth, and I believe
that I'm hearing the Kingdom of Heaven <em>through</em> you
- that it isn't you, it <em>is</em> our Heavenly Father, it <em>is</em>
the Kingdom of Heaven speaking through you, if I really believe
it, can I be saved? That's your <em>best chance</em> of being saved.
But I'm afraid from my point of view, I see that instruction
still has with it that if you hear this information, there is
just barely time for you to overcome. So, if there's time for
me to overcome, then why am I asking the question, "can I
be saved"?
<p>
Let's go back to 2000 years ago when Jesus said, 'If you believe
on Me and you do to the best of your ability what I say to do.'
He might as well have even said, "You may not have overcome
the world sufficiently to not need to return, but you can be saved,
because you're in the <em>process</em> of overcoming." And
it was the same thing as saying, "If you believe in Me, and
you are a disciple, and you've connected with the Kingdom of Heaven
through me, then you will be taken to My Father's House and you
will be put in the 'fridge' - or you will be 'put on ice' - until
an appropriate time to replant you so that you can get on with
your overcoming and arrive at the point where you can then move
up, not needing to return."
<p>
If we're receiving instruction that even these students can help
you, that there's <em>barely</em> time for you to do overcoming
of your own sufficiently to not need to return, then why would
we even want to think of, well, "Can I just be saved, without
overcoming"? I'm afraid that I would be fearful that the
One who was in the position of judging whether I could be saved,
that His decision would be colored by my saying, "I'm not
sure I can overcome fast enough, but will I be saved"? Wouldn't
I want to be more concerned with, "Goodness, if I can do
my dead level best, give it everything I have to be in the full
thrust of overcoming, then I <em>know</em> that my Heavenly Father
will <em>not</em> forsake me, would <em>not</em> lose me. If I recognize
I want Him, I am a lost sheep, I am someone who wants to get back
into His House, back into the hands of the Creator that made me...,
if I give everything I have...." And I say the same is true
for you, if you do <em>everything you can do</em> to get as close
as you can get as fast as you can get, and not reject what the
Kingdom of Heaven has given to you as the means for that help,
then there's no way that our Father would discard you, or do less
than save you from "the reaper" or from whatever catastrophes
might accompany the end of the Age.
<p>
I'm afraid I've got to go on in this same context and say that
at the end of the Age, not only is our Father's House a part of
the reaping process, but so is Lucifer's house. It is Lucifer,
don't forget, that says, "You don't have to do anything.
Just believe on Jesus." And Luci has put himself right
there in that position where he is calling himself Jesus<strong>:</strong> "I'm
Jesus. I will tell you through your prayers, I will give you
that confidence, I will give you that feeling of 'I'm saved by
the blood of the Lamb. That's all I have to do.'" I hate
to tell you, you're not connected with our Father's House, 
though you want to be. You want to be connected. Though you
want goodness, though you want God, though you want to be a part
of our Creator's Household - our Father, our Creator, has
rules and says, "When I send you Truth, when I send you updates,
when I send you information on how you can come into My House,
you can't just relate to the information I gave 2000 years ago."
Because you were the ones that deserved to receive My Father's
Household, Luci dives in and he grasps you and he attracts you
and attempts to get you hooked through misinformation. He even
says, "Just call on Jesus." (But Luci would have you
call on Him in the wrong ways - not call on Him the way Jesus
said.) Jesus said, 'You've got to overcome the world. Come and
follow Me. Leave everything. You can't even be My disciple unless
you give up your <em>whole world</em>, leave your <em>whole life</em>
behind, and come and follow Me.' Now, that's not just because
that is what Jesus said, that's what <em>any</em> Representative
from the Kingdom of Heaven would say when it's time that someone
has a possibility of moving from the human kingdom into our Heavenly
Father's Kingdom and staying there and receiving the rewards of
that Kingdom.
<p>
I know this is hard to take. And I know if you were a devoted,
a devout Christian and you're hearing what I am saying, that your
head is being pounded on at this moment, and you're saying, "How
do I know that this guy who's talking to me that says he's 'Do,'
how do I know he's not Satan, he's not Lucifer"? You don't.
Something inside of you has to know. Go search your Scriptures.
Go get back in your closet and say to your Heavenly Father
- reach to the Most High God - saying, "I don't want to settle
for less. I don't want to just adopt this misinformation if it's
misinformation. If I, too, must separate from the world, if I,
too, in order to get in Your Household, must drop everything as
the disciples did 2000 years ago, if I, too, must overcome the
world, then please wake me up and let me see that and let me do
it and lead me to it." I wish I could say to you that our
Father's Kingdom has lots of Reps around with the information
of how to overcome the world. Ti and I keep searching for them.
We don't want to be the only Reps that are here at this time.
I hope that we're not. There may be others, but we haven't found
them yet.
<p>
I know how hidden we have been. Maybe <em>they </em>(other Reps)<em>
</em>are hidden. Maybe they're with classrooms that will surface,
and they know the same Truth. Do you think Ti and I wouldn't
welcome it, and applaud and say hooray,...ray,...ray, here's somebody
else who's from the Kingdom of Heaven, and knows the same formula,
and is offering this same formula? For we do know one thing<strong>:</strong>
you have to overcome the world. You have to separate from the world.
You can't take any of the ties to this world
with you into that world without knowing that you're going to
have to return and sever them eventually if you expect to gain
membership <em>in </em>that Kingdom and serve <em>in</em> that Kingdom
as a member <em>of </em>that Kingdom.
<p>
The human kingdom is not where your major service is. That's
part of "misinformation." The human kingdom is a lesson
ground. It's for "hard knocks." <em>It's designed that
nothing work so that you would look for your Heavenly Father</em>.
No matter what Luci tries, it doesn't work. The only way he
gets you is to have you accept all the misinformation as truth.
He says, "If you live a good life, if you take care of your
family, you set aside the money, you buy your insurance policies,
you leave a nice trust fund so that the kids' college is paid
for<strong>;</strong> and when I go, then my wife is taken care of<strong>;</strong> and when she
goes, the kids are taken care of<strong>;</strong> and we go to death with no fear
because we know that we died in the Lord." I'm afraid it's
the <em>wrong Lord</em>. I mean, the Christians who are out there
now are even saying, "The Lord wants you to have things.
He wants you to have nice things." That's true, He does.
But he doesn't want you to pursue them. He doesn't want you
to <em>pursue</em> them. He says, "Don't pursue anything.
<em>Pursue only Me. Me! </em>Nothing else. I'm sorry, you can't
bring anything with you. Can't bring your wife with you, can't
bring your kids with you." It doesn't mean your wife can't
come, doesn't mean your kids can't come, but <em>you</em> can't
bring them <em>with</em> you. You have to come <em>alone</em>, having
<em>severed</em> everything, and your relationship is only with
our Heavenly Father, saying, "You're all I want. I want nothing
else." At that time, when you're in that mindset and you're
willing to drop everything and leave everything behind, He sees
you through it. <em>You</em> can't actually do the severing. He
pulls it away as you ask. He pulls it a step at a time as you
ask. And a lot of times the things that you would like for Him
to pull away, He doesn't pull away that fast. Because He wants
to develop strength within you, effort to continue to work against
that thing and not give in to it, so that you get into His Kingdom
with some "muscle," and some ability to have some significant
service as a member of His Kingdom.
<p>
Well, sounds like it must be Sunday, or Saturday, depending on
when your Sabbath day is, and I've gotten into preaching. I couldn't
help it. But where did we leave off here? Who's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> It's going to be hard to figure out where it's best to
dive in, but let's see.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> That's all right, let's go to our next question.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I wondered if you could define the difference between
the vehicle and the soul, just for a point of reference.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> That's a good place to start. The vehicle and the soul. 
There's only one place that souls come from - our Father's
Kingdom. There's only one Creator in all that exists, and that's
the "Top Man," that's the Chief of Chiefs, the God of
Gods. And don't misunderstand that or find fault with it. I
mean if you want to find fault with that, that's your choice.
You can find fault with anything I say if that's what's on your
mind - to find fault. There's only one Creator and that's
our Father's Kingdom. And He teaches Creation. He made souls.
Luci and his camp cannot make souls. What I left out that I
started to tell you a few minutes ago is that here at the end
of the Age, Luci is even getting members, an army, into <em>his
</em>kingdom at the end of the Age - those he really wants who
have become good servants and have bought his misinformation.
If our Father's House wants to, He can let those who have bought
into misinformation move into his (Luci's) kingdom.
<p>
What we don't know is when Luci's judgment day is (an actual
point in time). He's already received a sentence. He knows he's
going to lose his life, his very existence. And his higher cadre,
or his higher echelon of his officers, they're going to lose theirs
too. But we don't know that our Father hasn't designed it that
after that happens that someone isn't going to fall in line to
replace Lucifer, or Satan, and his higher officers, and his whole
"officer's candidate school," those that follow his
misinformation as if it were the truth. But Luci <em>wants</em>
souls. He also wants vehicles. Now, <em>he</em> has to <em>indoctrinate</em>.
There's one big, big, big difference between our Father's Kingdom
and Luci's kingdom. Our Father's Kingdom is not the aggressor.
Our Father's Kingdom says, "<em>Ask</em>, and you receive.
<em>Seek</em>, and ye find. <em>Be quiet, and know that I am God</em>."
Luci says, "Hey, <em>listen</em>." He's the aggressor.
He tells you what you're supposed to believe. He justifies his
misinformation. He thinks that he's really great. He thinks
that he's adding numbers to his "kingdom of heaven,"
because his "kingdom of heaven" is beyond the confines
of planet Earth. I mean, the main issue of what's going on here
in the conflict of good and evil is not just on planet Earth.
That's insignificant in comparison. The main issue of even numbers
is <em>in the heavens</em>.
<p>
Even at this time, when ufologists and the whole community of
people who are so aware of space aliens, are asking<strong>:</strong> "Do
they have a presence on this planet? Are there bases where they
do genetic experimentation, and are they growing actual creatures
there? Do they abduct humans, and do they do genetic experimentation?
Do they also do artificial insemination with humans, and bring
back the child and show it to the mother"? All these events
have "surfaced" in the last few years. They're not
the way of our Father's Kingdom. They are the way of these
misinformation people who do not believe that they are misinformation.
They are not knowingly misinformation. They've bought into another
idea, into other information. We've talked about this in the
class a lot. It's like our Father's "corporation" at
one time was the only corporation. And at a given time, someone
said, "Oh, I think I'm going to step out of our Father's
corporation. I've learned a lot, but I think I can go further.
I don't like the position I'm staying in. It seems restrictive
to me. It seems that I am limited." Don't forget, we discussed
the other day that you can't lose the option to think poorly.
You can't even lose the option of rejecting your connection.
You can't lose the option of rejecting the Truth. That option
always stays with you, even in the Kingdom of Heaven.
<p>
Okay, here's this corporation that belonged to our Father's Kingdom
and it was the only corporation at a given time. And then this
member says, "I don't like this limiting, this restricting
position that I'm in, because my Older Member...I don't think He's
that smart. He holds me back. I could really be moving forward."
And so he goes out here and forms another corporation. And he
begins to do things and His Father says, "Wait a minute.
You're not looking to Me. You're going on your own. You're
doing something altogether different." And he recognizes
that he's going different. He acknowledges that he's going different.
Then at a given time, our Father's Kingdom, or the One [the Older
Member] that was connected to Luci, the One that was His Father,
said, "I can't let you come back into our House.
I can't let you come back into our world." I'm talking
about a physical place, a part of the Heavens, the physical
part of the heavens that only those can go who are members of
<em>our</em> Father's House, <em>our</em> Father's corporation,
in <em>His</em> Kingdom - the one which belongs to the Creator.
And He says, "I can't let you go on with your behavior and your
thinking, and your renegade attitude, and your letting this ego
come back in where you want to 'be somebody.' I can't let you
come back into this place. I'm going to confine you to outside
of this camp."
<p>
It's so easy at this time to be deceived. It's rumored that
space aliens have even met with humans, have met with the
military of different nations, conducted experimentation on
spacecrafts, that governments have even agreed to let them do
certain things as long as they give us some of their technical
knowledge. How much of that is true, I don't know. I don't want
to know. But whatever of it is true, I see all the earmarks of
"the renegade," the misinformation. I'm just telling you that
those who are misinformation, they do not know that they are
misinformation. But they usually have bought an easier "out"
that required less of them, and they were assured of self-
elevation. In our Father's Kingdom there's no assurance of self-
elevation. If you want to be a servant, you give up "self." You
become <em>nothing.</em> You crave to be nothing so badly that you scream
for even loss of "identity." And our Father's Kingdom says,
"Wait a minute. Since I can't take away your option, your
choices, then you're still going to have some identity. I may
call you 'this' in this task, and call you 'that' in that task.
But you have to have some sort of identity that I'll give you.
So, I can't let you just give yourself to me and then forget
about it, and 'you' are ended, because you're a servant. I
permitted you to come back as an individual and be a servant.
But if you want to be an individual and you're not pleased with
the rate of growth as I give it to you through My
Representatives, then you're going to go in opposition to Me.
You're going to stray from Me."
<p>
So, there are literally many, many, many members now that
are in the misinformation corporation, and they're serving
(thinking they're serving the truth) the "universal mind," the
"cosmic consciousness," the "we are gods." Even as you
investigate space aliens, or their vehicles, you'll see things
that you wouldn't see in our Father's Kingdom. Our Father's
Kingdom doesn't make babies. They get "babies" from the human
kingdom adults who have graduated from the human kingdom, so
there's no gender. They don't have ties; therefore, there's no
marrying, there's no little kids running around, even though
there are "babies," because they are there for the first time.
Now, I'm not saying that our Father's Kingdom couldn't certainly
bring children in and families in for certain lessons that He
might have on His agenda. Who am I to say that He wouldn't do
that. I don't know what all is on His agenda, because that's
certainly His mind, not mine.
<p>
I'm just trying to share with you some of the understanding
that has been given to us on these important issues of: The Last
Days, What is "being saved"? What does this period of time mean
to me? If you're listening to me, I'll tell you that Luci and
his kingdom have a lot of individuals who can work in the
invisible, and who can pound on your head and say, "Don't listen
to that! Don't listen to that! <em>I've</em> found the truth for you and
I'll give it to you in the name of what you believed 2000 years
ago." You've brought that "2000 years ago" into today and you're
going to hang onto that history as if it were yours. That's true
history. That was real. And it is yours. But when our Father's
Kingdom sends new information, sends updates, new opportunities - if
you were really connected with our Father's information, if you
really knew the Truth that was <em>in</em> Jesus - you're going to see
it here again. You're seeing that same Mind. What is in a soul
is "truth" or "falsehood" - the mind of God or the mind of
misinformation. That's the reason it boils down to - we're either
<em>for</em> Him or we're <em>against</em> Him.
<p>
Well, goodness, we just got started. We haven't touched but
two or three questions and somebody just held up a card - I saw
it - it said 30 seconds. So, we're going to have to take up more
issues in our next session. I'm glad that you have gotten these
sessions, that you've watched this, and that you want to learn.
I hope that the Next Level can use us as their instruments for
you. See you next time.
