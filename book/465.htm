Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 11
</strong>
(95 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr/>

There you are! This is our eleventh session. It might be our
last. We hope that it will be - unless it's inadequate. We've
kind of begun to feel like it might wind down at this point.
We're glad to see you, particularly if you're on our Father's
side and you're beginning to recognize that the information about
His Kingdom that is being shared with you is true, that you can
<em>see</em> that it is true. If that's happening, then we're happy
for what you're beginning to feel, because we know that at the
point that you're recognizing that you are very possibly a son
of His...I can't even imagine that you would begin to recognize
it if that possibility is not there for you.
<p>
Earlier, in preparation for this session, I told the crew here
that during the morning hours, as I was getting my bath, I received
information that I would consider to be our punch line, or the
finale of this series. So, I'm excited about giving it to you,
but I'm not going to give it to you right now. I'm going to use
it as something to help us move quickly with our little questions
as we proceed.
<p>
I'm happy that our two teleprompters could be here today to assist
with questions. We welcome them to this project. Let's just
get right on and see how quickly we can move. So, why don't you
tell me what's first on our list of questions?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Is there a detox time that affects the clarity of the
head?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> A detox time for clarity of the head. There certainly is,
and let's try to explain that to you. In the same way that if
you've been on a drunk and you're really intoxicated, you really
don't have clarity of head. You don't know what you're doing.
You can't really think very straight until that begins to wane
from your system, until it starts to get out of your chemistry.
And that's true whether it be drugs, or alcohol, or whatever
affects your system so strongly. We've discussed that all of
the human behavior, all the little things that humans do that
are not done in our Heavenly Father's Kingdom, are in a sense
drugs. They affect our chemistry. They affect our thinking.
They affect the clarity of our head. The one that seems to be
the worst drug of all is that of sensuality, or sexuality. Even
though humans are unaware that it puts them in a drunken condition,
or are certainly unaware that there is a detox period, or a withdrawal
period, our experience is that we can see it very clearly, because
we have all experienced what an effect it has on interfering with
our detox, our clarity of head.
<p>
When as a classroom, Ti and I took these students into the woods,
as we mentioned before, and we began our overcoming in earnest,
we explained that this behavior had to stop. Now I'm going to
move to another topic, then come right back to this "detox."
This morning, in working with some members of the class that
wanted to assist in the preparation of the jacket material for
this series, we were overcome with how lucky we were in this big,
beautiful picture of our Father's Kingdom - the picture that has
been given to us, the information that, piece by piece, forms
a puzzle and a giant picture that tells us so much about our Father's
Kingdom, so much about the human kingdom, and even other aspects
of His creation. Most of all it tells that it's for one reason
only - it's for the purpose of assisting potential graduates from
the human kingdom into our Father's Kingdom. It explains how
that is done and gives the specific, step-by-step instructions
and disciplines that must be employed to make that transition.
And we've noticed how, as we take instruction, and as we apply
instructions and procedures, so frequently we say, "That
makes a lot of sense," because we've recognized that all
of this picture makes a lot of sense.
<p>
Now, let's go back to detox. This information doesn't necessarily
make a lot of sense if we aren't really sober. And we can't be
sober until we have had some time behind us, away from those things
that change our consciousness and keep our consciousness on them.
<p>
Let's talk a moment about how sensuality, or sexuality, is such
a drug. You know, an alcoholic, if he has a certain number of
drinks during a day, he can say, "It's common, others have
so many drinks a day. I'm certainly not an alcoholic."
I can remember hearing people say, "I'm not an alcoholic
because I don't drink before noon," as if that's where someone
becomes an alcoholic, if they drink before noon. I don't know
what various bases people have, where they draw the line, saying,
"If I fall off dead drunk, or if I have to quit my work,
then I'm an alcoholic." Or "If I can't hold down a
job, then I'm an alcoholic," - whatever the various areas
are. But whatever habit they have associated with that indulgence,
it causes them to keep returning. They used the clock, or the
passage of time, as a reminder. If someone is used to having
a drink with or after their lunch, or one at cocktails in the
evening before they have their evening meal, and they <em>miss</em>
that time, then something says, "Whoops, I missed that time.
I missed that drink." Then if they miss the next time for
that little fix, if we may call it that, then they begin to be
more aware of the fact that they're behind in their dosage of
what it is that they are interested in.
<p>
With sexuality, as a drug, it's the same way. When people are
vibrating at the level of participating in sexuality, they become
quite aware of how long it's been since they've had their fix,
or since they have participated in that which was so much pleasure.
And they know how it draws them to that - any image that would
encourage them to participate in that activity. In the same way
that an alcoholic would be drawn to an open bottle and a glass
of his favorite scotch, or whatever it is that he liked to drink,
the same thing happens in our sexuality if we open a magazine
and we see a picture that would turn on the vehicle, or the influences
that are using the vehicle. Then it's triggered, and we start
having images in our heads, and we start imagining participating
in that activity. So, if you stop and think of all the aspects
of sexuality and sensuality, you can see how they draw us in.
In the same way, the human world considers drinking alcohol fairly
accepted behavior, and certainly sexuality in most societies is
considered acceptable behavior. As you go from one society to
another, one society, because of its religious background, might
feel more that sexuality should be saved for marriage, and others
of a different religion are more for saving it for when you want
to have children. But generally, the longer the Age exists and
the more liberal the world becomes, the more it's considered to
be just an indulgence in pleasure.
Now, it's even beginning to expose itself as an indulgence in
pleasure, so much so that "I have a right to do what I want to
with my body, and if I choose to get rid of the result of my
indulgence in pleasure, and it turned out to be a pregnancy
that I didn't want, then I
certainly ought to have a right to do what I want to about the
side-effects of my indulgence." So, it seems to be acceptable
as an indulgence, to whatever degree I want to indulge in it.
Now, of course, with the problem of AIDS and other diseases that
might be passed, people begin to put up a little guard. But they
even get so hooked on their booze of sex, if I might use that,
that they even forget to use their protection. Or they forget,
if they are so taken by the person that they're about to have
that experience with, that they lose control and they realize,
"Whoops, I didn't even protect myself." And in nearly
every segment of society, we promote this degree of sensuality.
I mean, it's considered to be a healthy act. It's considered
to be a normal act.
<p>
When it comes to that in any given Age and in any society, it's
almost impossible to talk to them about a kind of picture, as
we talked about in a previous session, that you have to move into
on a basis of the kind of evidence that is revealed to you as
a result of your faith - the evidence being this big picture.
And then, because of your faith and continuing to stay away from
those drugs in your overcoming, you begin to see the big picture.
It becomes more clear to you. Soon it makes so much sense to
you that you say, "Great goodness! I can't imagine why I
could do anything else. I'm so glad this has been revealed to
me. I feel so lucky in seeing it." And we are extremely
lucky to have been given that. But the question that the student
asked, "Does detox fit into this"? - it does. You will
have only a little glimpse, and you will then deal with doubt.
You might expect to continue to deal with doubt and doubt and
doubt, wondering if this is the right thing to do. And the pangs
of the world that you might be trying to break away from will
want to draw you back in the same way that a drug would want to
draw you back, until you have separated more from them. Not only
the distance, but a little time gets between you and them, and
detox begins to take effect - it begins to work with you. So,
that is certainly a valid question that can help us in overcoming.
If we know that if we can stick to this, and just stick to it,
and stick to it, and put that behind us, and it doesn't exist,
I don't even identify with being alcoholic anymore...I don't
even identify with those vibrations, they aren't there - as far
as I'm concerned, they weren't there, it doesn't connect with
me - then my head becomes clearer and clearer, and I become like
an innocent child that can see a picture that is given to me.
I can see it exactly for what it is. And all these demons don't
come rushing in to try to destroy it for me because they are under
control. They had to become under control as I was led through
my own detox program.
<p>
Well, I said we were going to move on, and we're going to try
to move quickly today. So, what's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> You've probably covered this, but I was going to ask
what about learning to exert the effort to change?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I'm afraid we haven't covered it enough, and I'm glad you
brought it up. I can remember Ti saying so many times in our
classroom, "If you just would exert the effort"! That
doesn't necessarily mean anything to you if you don't understand
the meaning. Change does not take place by examination. Change
does not take place by analysis, by running it through your head
again and again. It only takes place by <em>doing</em> it. For
example, if you're doing a procedure, or you're on a lesson plan
where you're to stop something, the quicker you can get past examining
how you're going to do it, and you start doing it, then change
begins to take place. But so many times, particularly in the
human world, we talk about it, we examine it, and a lot of times
that's all we really wanted to do, is examine it and talk about
it and philosophize on it and write books on it, and "Oh,
it was a neat idea," but no change takes place. I'm the
same person that I was before I wrote the book. Just had a lot
of neat thoughts.
<p>
When we're changing from the human kingdom into our Father's
Kingdom, we lose our identity a number of times along the way.
We become a different individual, a different individual, and
a different individual. And I'm sure that it could have certain
drawbacks. I'm sure that as some of the class members visited
with their family, their family could say, "I don't know
this person anymore." And they would wonder, "Where
is that person that I used to know"? I'm afraid that they
would be right, that they don't know that person anymore. Now,
sometimes the class members try to pretend to be that person,
if that's what the family is looking for. But it even becomes
pretty obvious when you're pretending and you realize something's
different here about this individual. And the more we change,
the more difficult it becomes for us to identify with those who
put us in the position of what they used to remember us to be.
The important point here, though, in this little question is,
"I've got to stop talking about it. I've got to stop just
examining it or analyzing it. I have to move forward. It takes
<em>work</em>."
<p>
Another label that we put on that frequently is just simple procrastination.
"I can't really get with it. I plan to do it and we're
going to do it tomorrow." ASAP (as soon as possible) is
an instruction we have. As soon as we learn about it, then the
<em>first</em> opportunity is when we do it...whatever it is,
any new instruction. When we hear of it, then what's stopping
us? Why wouldn't we do it right then? We'd have to be sure that
something else would be higher priority to prevent us from doing
it right then. So, it's very important that we learn to move
with change, discard our old self, move into our new identity,
make that adjustment, not try to bring that old one with us, or
there's calamity there. It just simply doesn't work.
<p>
Okay, what's next? Is that the completion of that one?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> On that particular one, yes.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, what's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Do you want to touch on the principle of "I could
be wrong"?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes. What she's talking about here is that in our classroom
we received instruction way back at the beginning that one of
the best tools we could have in how to present our thinking and
how to work with our partners, and in a crew situation and with
our teachers, is that when we're making an observation or we're
voicing an observation, we say, "I could be wrong, but it
seemed that so-and-so and so-and-so." It doesn't work when
we're just <em>saying</em> it. For awhile, nearly all the students
would say it when they didn't mean it. And they had to learn
that it doesn't work if you don't mean it. And so you could say,
"How are you going to mean it? How are you going to
say, 'I could be wrong,' when you believe you're right"?
So, let's examine that for a second. It means that I need to
stop trusting my judgment of the circumstance, or my observation,
or any kind of judgment that I might have. And if I stop trusting
it, stop believing it, then I am losing self-confidence. Yes,
that's one of the things we lose in this transition, self-confidence.
We become like a child that says, "I don't know anything.
I don't have any self-confidence in anything." I have to
look to the Next Level. I have to let the Representative from
the Next Level serve in that position of whom I look to. I have
to say, "<em>You </em>know what's right." And if I bring
things to my Older Member's attention, I say, "I think you
asked for this, so I'll share with you what you asked me to on
my observation of this, or what I thought about this, but I could
certainly be wrong." And it has to be sincere if we are
genuinely going to move into the position of not having self-confidence.
<p>
Believe it or not, since the world out there is so artificial,
and therefore our judgment as humans was artificial, as we move
into the transition of becoming babes in our Father's Kingdom,
by saying "I could be wrong," we begin to lose the confidence
that we used to have in the artificial. We have less and less,
and soon we learn that we <em>were</em> wrong. And that comes as
kind of a shock to us because we thought that we were right.
Then we think, "If it's a good lesson to lose self-confidence
and say 'I could be wrong,' then I'll try to do that sincerely."
But it almost comes as a shock when you actually realize that
again and again you are shown that what you thought was the case
in your observation or your judgment wasn't right. So, you then
say, "It's working. I am dropping the artificial."
In other words, "I'm not sold out any longer to the wrong
side. I'm losing the programming. I'm being led through, step-by-step,
destroying the old programming and realizing that it is not true,
that over here is the truth." And you are given the understanding
of the truth and the ability to recognize it if you faithfully
do the steps as they come along. Of course, Satan's side could
say, "Who's to say that as you move over here into the new
computer and its program, that that isn't the artificial and the
old is the real"? We wouldn't try to convince you of one
way or the other. We're not selling into that. But what we have
been given to move into, we wouldn't trade for what we had...for
anything. That is, those who have stuck to it faithfully long
enough to make that transition, to do enough detoxing, to lose
enough self-confidence, have moved into the position of looking
at that picture and saying, "That makes a lot of sense."
And then they start working harder at completing the breaking
away from those habits they used to have, and moving into a new
identity, then moving into a new identity, and so on.
<p>
I'm trying to move fast. I'll stop...it's so hard to stop.
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Did we talk about a lazy mind or a weak thirst? Is that
part of the control of the pump?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I think we spoke of it, but I don't think we spoke enough
of it. I know it would be valuable for us to speak of it again.
In a sense, we spoke of it just a moment ago when we were talking
about procrastination. That's a weak thirst. That's, in a sense,
kind of a weak pump - when I put something off. Or if I am slow
to lose an old identity and move a step ahead, then that's a weak
pump. To be satisfied with a slow pace is deadly. Really, seriously
deadly. Because we can get very much behind. What if the classroom
that you're in, if a lot of the class members are moving very
quickly and they're making these adjustments, they're discarding
the old and they're seeing the new, and they're moving into their
new position. If certain ones, without recognizing it, thought
they were moving quick, but their perception of what was quick
was poor, their judgment of it, they really never knew that they
were slow, until it was brought to their attention. They have
to then put in new chip and say, "I've got to replace that
old one that misjudged. That was slow. That was tardy. That
was too pleased with slow movement."
<p>
Lethargy is a very "sinful" item, if we can put it
in that context, and it's difficult to get beyond it. It's difficult
to be eager and quick. But when we change into the habit, there
are certain habits in our Father's Kingdom that pay off. I mean,
we're not changing all habits for no habit. There are certain
habits that pay off. And moving quickly with full energy, abiding
by instructions so carefully, knowing procedures, <em>liking </em>procedures,
liking to <em>change</em> as it is given to us, not wanting to be
the old self - those are new habits. And they move us. That
becomes, then, a <em>rich</em> thirst, one that is very thirsty.
"Just can't wait until another day and more lessons and
opportunities." And a lot of times when we are in that position,
boy do they start coming! And we think, "Wow, what did I
ask for? This is pretty tough." But we get used to it,
and we recognize it. And when it comes, then we say, "Well,
I got what I was asking for. I got this new lesson, and it's
right before me." Though it might be tough, it's just like
asking an instructor in the chemistry lab for the next lesson,
and he gives you one, and you say, "Well, I didn't mean one
this tough." (Laughs) And that happens to us all the time.
But after we get it, we're honored that they thought we could
handle it. So, we have to prove that we can handle it - we can
rise above it. And then we become a little bit different from
what we were before. So, weak thirst is deadly. Keeping a strong
pump and moving ahead is a very, very important new habit to establish
as we move into our Father's Kingdom. Does that complete that
question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> That does. Thank you.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, can the Next Level withdraw mind if we abuse it
or don't use it?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Goodness, that kind of twists our brain around in a little
funny place, and I'm afraid the answer is yes. Now, you can think,
"That sounds kind of cruel." You know, we've talked
about how our Father's Kingdom does a lot of the work with us
and we're unaware of what they're doing. I know that many times
Ti, and those who are helping Ti, have done things that I'll recognize
they have done in direct association with us, and it's only after
they've done them that I've thought, "Gracious, nobody could
have done that but Ti and those working with Ti. Because this
certainly wasn't anything that we even thought of, or even participated
in, and it was done." And we could see that it was for our
sakes that it was done. We didn't even ask, but it was done because
they realized if we were going to move forward, that it needed
to be done.
<p>
Now, back to her question. We've talked about the soul that
has the mind of our Father in it, and it has some mind of this
world in it. We're trying to chip off that mind of the world
that we don't want in it, and to get it out of there as quickly
as possible and fill up that soul container, that "pillowcase,"
with the Mind of our Father's Kingdom.
If we're in a unit like this classroom, where the Next
Level wants to give us information and they're trying to consider
the unit, yet as they give us information, maybe some members
of that unit aren't really taking it to heart, or they're slow,
or they're trying to pretend to do it because they like certain
aspects of the classroom and it's comfortable in certain areas,
so they're not really examining if they could be moving faster.
Those are all symptoms of abusing that Mind as It is given to
you. If it's artificial, if you're not really moving into that
position, we have seen some members of our classroom all of a
sudden just turn almost 180 degrees. It was like we didn't know
them. They had to leave the classroom, and we felt so <em>sorry</em>
that that had happened. We're not saying that they couldn't recover
that. I'm afraid that's between them and my Older Member because
in that position (being outside the class), I'm not out there
to help them.
<p>
We have also experienced members of our classroom who have been
outside the classroom for a while and have come back in. Some
who are on our crew today are in that position. They are back
in the classroom and they're moving quickly in the right direction.
It thrills us so to see that out of their own desperate thirst,
and their acknowledgment that this was true, that they got help
from our Father's Kingdom outside of this relationship that helped
them get back into the classroom and back on track in a laboratory
experience of a unit going through this process of discipline,
change, and getting to our Father's Kingdom. But it is true,
it is something we have to be concerned about, that a gift of
information can be given to you, you can increase it in that space,
but if you don't do anything about it and you insist on clinging
to this other information within that container, or that pillowcase,
and there isn't room for all of it, our Father can very easily
just move in there and pull that right out, and suddenly you've
lost your respect for what it was, because it isn't there, it
was removed from you. And then you still have the choice of what
to do about that moment. Choice is something you always have.
Choice and that pump. And you can then choose to say, "It
must not have been worth anything." You know, it's up to
you. Or if it just destroys you and you feel vacant and empty,
and you have to have it back, then you may have to prove to some
Representative from our Father's Kingdom who's working with you
outside the classroom that you are worthy of returning to a classroom
situation and getting further instruction in that. So, it can
be withdrawn.
<p>
I'm trying to move quickly. Okay? What's the next one on our
list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, with that in mind, is there a limit to Next Level's
patience?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes. And I should stop right there, but I'll say a couple
of words on that. There is a limit. Now, I think that any person
in our Father's Kingdom who's assigned to a task would never exercise
that limit to patience without checking with their Older Member.
And, of course, their Older Member's going to check with their
Older Member, and so forth up the pipeline. All that can happen
pretty quickly. The time lapse in that computer isn't that big.
But when they do question it and the instruction comes back,
they can say, "Well, the best thing we can do <em>for</em>
them is to be impatient." And then you understand, "Oh,
so it's instruction to treat it this way, and it's not really
just impatience." So, at times we do get instruction to
be impatient in order to help that individual be shocked or to
realize "I've got to get out of this. I can't just expect
to be babied. I don't need to stay where I am." I can imagine
that sometimes, as some of the classroom watches these tapes,
they can recognize that there's a certain amount of relationship
that I might be having with the viewer on the other end of that
camera that might be slightly different from my relationship with
them at times. I think we've even discussed it. In a sense,
I almost feel like a twice-removed...or a grandfather speaking
to a grandchild. Of course, I'm speaking to you as someone who
might be wondering if they are standing outside of the vehicle
that they are using, and wondering if they want to take it over
and pursue this. And since we are given the task of trying to
give that to you, and since we're so eager for you to participate
in it, for it to become <em>yours</em>, then we are influenced by
that.
<p>
When I'm dealing with one of these students in a particular area,
I might come on a little stronger if I have instruction to do
so, and I might be pretty direct and right to the point, because
I am assuming that they're on solid ground. They have chosen
this<strong>;</strong> they're doing what they want to do. But they've also learned
to recover quickly and be appreciative when we take a direct method
instead of, "Well, we'll bring that up in a week or so when
they get maybe past what they're dealing with now." We don't
have a timetable that can handle that. We deal with things immediately.
I don't know if we said it clearly in previous sessions, but
at one time within the classroom, we even agreed that we would
expose things that we have permitted in our mind, or some activity
that we've done - that we would make a vow to our partner and
to the rest of our class that we would expose it that day - that
we would not go down in our bunk without having acknowledged it,
exposed it, and gotten past it, because we recognized how things
can compound so easily. And I can become more and more separate
if I let things mount and don't expose things. So, that's a part
of our procedure.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, could you give us some examples of tasks or activities
in our Father's Kingdom? You mentioned radio signals?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> That's a good one. I'm glad we brought that up. We don't
have a lot of knowledge of the activities that go on in our Father's
Kingdom. We have little, tiny glimpses of what might go on, but
we don't know the particulars too well. I suspect that the reason
that they don't let us know the particulars about that is because
we would probably go around so pleased with it that we'd boast
about it. And that wouldn't be appropriate. You might say, "What's
going to replace being a clerk in the department store, or working
in the hospital"? That's a good one, because our Father's
Kingdom has a fairly close equivalent to the hospital or the emergency
ward, or certain things related to medicine and trying to save
lives. One area that we suspect where our Father's Kingdom dives
in and has a lot of work to do is when a soul is leaving a vehicle.
In other words, the leaf is falling off that particular family
vine. And that soul then is lifted out of that vehicle for that
period of time. And we feel that it is an action of our Father's
Kingdom, if that soul has any significant relationship to our
Father's Kingdom. In other words, it depends upon what is in
that soul, what degree of that soul is made up of goodness or
mind from our Father's Kingdom. We don't know where they draw
the line. They may even participate in handling these souls and
helping them get from one fallen leaf to the next potential new
leaf, or coming through the womb so that they take a new vehicle.
We don't know where they draw that line, but we do feel very strongly
that one of the activities of our Father's Kingdom is helping souls
being released from a vehicle and taking possession of another
one, or moving into another one. Now, we've got to mention here
just for a moment how would another vehicle qualify to house a
particular soul? In order to qualify, that other vehicle has
to have a match for all of the things that that soul was hooked
on in its previous leaf. This new leaf has to have the potential
for all of those things, because what the soul hasn't overcome,
it's going to have to overcome. So, that soul doesn't get to
go out of the body and be clean and free just because it got to
die, so to speak. Of course, it didn't get to die...just the
vehicle withered and fell off the branch. So, this is, we feel,
definitely an activity of our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
What about radio signals? You know, the British Broadcasting
Company, or, what are the names of some of these other free radio
shows like Radio Free Europe or Voice of America? These signals
that are sent out over the air are kind of propaganda, and people
who have their radios, be it shortwave or whatever - receive those
signals that are actually sent out. Now, our Father's Kingdom,
and even Satan's kingdom, they can <em>realistically</em> send out
radio signals to our brains on frequencies that humans do not
have the capacity to even perceive. Now, we've read some books
where some humans have actually been advanced in their laboratory
experiments with computers and oscillators and have actually learned
of some frequencies from which, they felt like, they could pick
up transmissions from space aliens, or from other camps. We feel
that the way these radio signals work is quite different from
this camp over here - Satan's camp, Lucifer's camp. Their propaganda's
going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on just about every channel
on the band, or every band on the dial. With our Father's Kingdom,
it's hard to find the bands<strong>;</strong> it takes effort to find the bands.
And when you find the band, it's silent. Why? Because it says,
"<em>Ask,</em> and you receive." On these other bands,
you don't have to ask anything. It all comes free. It's just
right there. It's just knocking you down. You turn to every
channel and you get a lot more than you ask for, and you hear
just about the same thing on every channel. If you stay on that
channel long enough, you'll hear the same information on all the
channels. And you find our Father's channel and you wonder, "Oh,
could that be from God," or could that be from whatever your
terminology is that might identify your relationship to our Father's
Kingdom. And it waits for you to ask, then sends you a radio
signal, and that's the way it is. They kind of help to give you
clues by it, because in the scripture they say, "Be still,
and know that I am God." In other words, it's "Be quiet."
And if there's some mind of God in you, it will kind of stir
you, and it will kind of coax you into saying, "Why don't
you ask? Why don't you ask"? And so then you, the chooser,
can say, "What about so-and-so, what about so-and-so"?
Then the answers begin to come. Not necessarily the answers
to the questions that you asked. They are ultimately the answers,
but they may not be the answers that you're expecting.
<p>
It's a very good analogy to realize that I said something that
could be questionable. You could say, "Well, that little
inner voice says, 'What about asking?'" I almost want to
erase that because it is not the way in our Father's Kingdom to
<em>ever</em> be the aggressor. It's because <em>you</em> possess,
by your choices, you possess that amount of mind of our Father's
Kingdom that translated in your head, "I wonder if I shouldn't
ask. I wonder if this could be my Father speaking to me in this
situation. This happened to me and I don't understand it. Maybe
I should ask, 'Is this some of your doing?'" So, the radio
signals analogy is not only a good analogy, it is <em>realistic</em>.
They send those signals out. They have that connection with
our brains, with the literal space that we occupy. They can speak
to us in that way. What we try to do is learn how to use the
radio. It takes a long time to get a good orientation on how
to use that radio in the right ways. Because that radio still
has all those dials you don't want to hear all those signals on.
And you have to learn how to flip past them fast enough that
you don't hear any words from them so you're not affected by them,
and how to get to those silent ones and then have a relationship
with our Father's Kingdom in that way. But it works! So, that's
another illustration of activities of our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
And, of course, one big activity of our Father's Kingdom that
we haven't talked about much is the strong possibility of what
can happen at the end of an Age. It's <strong>new</strong> to all the souls,
all the humans that are alive during that Age, and they would
have no evidence of it. We'd have no evidence of it because they
have no books that say this has ever happened before. In other
words, this is an activity where the Next Level comes in from
off, away from the planet, or even from out of bases, and they
have all kinds of things to do in harvesting at the end of the
Age. No one's expecting it because it's been wiped from their
memory, if they were in the prior Age where it happened then.
At least it appears that everyone's memory has been wiped. But
this is also a big activity time for gardeners...as Gardener's
helpers from our Father's Kingdom. All the little aspects, whether
it's soil samples, or checking on souls as they move from here
to there, and as they migrate from here to there as they are in
the process of breaking away from their ties. And watching them
even as they move from one country to another or one career to
another, as they begin to realize, "This isn't what I thought
I was looking for." The closer they get and the more they
drop, then the more attention they get from our Father's Kingdom
as far as monitoring and helping answer their requests or their
questions as they come through their radio signal.
<p>
That gives us a little picture. Let's move ahead. Who's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I think I was. Well, that certainly covers what can
happen to a soul at the point of losing its vehicle, but I was
wondering, what are some of the conditions the soul can be in
during its incarnations?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Between?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Between the incarnations.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> That's a good question. Okay. It certainly isn't right to
think that as a vehicle is lost, and as a soul leaves that vehicle,
then all those souls just go afloat out there and become discarnates.
This is an area that we don't know much about, and we're not
supposed to know much about. This is an area that is completely
controlled by our Father's Kingdom, though some from the opposing
forces are permitted to do certain tasks that they think are for
their soul's benefit. And, in a sense, if they're garbage removers,
it is for the benefit then even of our Father's Kingdom, if you
can follow that logic. But some souls might be taken out and
put aside, left in the cellar, kind of in a fridge or ice box
- in the freezer, in a dormant condition until an appropriate
time comes.
Let's say that some souls might have possibly (just to clarify
the analogy) in a previous time in this Age, or maybe in the Age
before - we don't know all these details - they might have begun
a whole lot of things on their checklist of things that they had
to overcome, but there were just a few things that weren't going
to come up again until a certain time, and our Father's Kingdom
knew when that time would be. Then wouldn't it make sense that those
souls would be taken out and left in a dormant state until that time?
In other words, they're kind of asleep. Jesus tried to illustrate
that as He spoke of death of the vehicle as asleep.
<p>
Oh, I'm afraid I have to bring up something I'll try to get rid
of quickly. As we listened to yesterday's tapes, we talked about
how Jesus in the condition of having experienced what was considered
to be death, in payment for the debt of the sins of those who
gave Him their notes, even though that was not really death
- because certainly His soul didn't die, it was only the vehicle
that was affected - it was <em>their </em>interpretation of what
death was. Now, the application of the word "death"
in the sense that sins - the wages of sin is death, or are death,
I don't know which is right - in the way that that might be a
vehicular death as against the soul death, might be the proper
application. The reason that humans continue to have to lose
vehicles, the reason they continue to be perishable and corruptible,
is because of their sin. So, I guess it works both ways, being
applicable to both the vehicle as well as the soul. The soul
is not going to be destroyed until our Father's Kingdom says it
has become nothing and holds nothing good - there's nothing there
except matter that can be recycled. And in that sense, then,
it isn't destroyed. It's just recycled. It's nonexistent because
it became nonexistent. Now, if the soul then becomes bigger and
goes into our Father's Kingdom, then it can receive even a vehicle
that is incorruptible and imperishable, and therefore, neither
the soul nor the vehicle would know death. But the "wages
of sin is death," or "are death," is illustrated
as it was in Jesus' mission - trying to help them to understand
our Father's Kingdom. Certainly, physical death was used as the
illustration, because that's what they thought death was. And
it might even be that physical death, or death of the plant, or
losing the physical vehicle is the result also of their sin, not
that the soul can't also be lost eventually as that mind deteriorates.
<p>
I got off the track a moment, but I felt we wanted to touch on
that for another second. Who's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> How high a priority is liking to stick to procedures?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> About as high as they get. I mean, there's nothing that can
happen to me, or any student of our Father's Kingdom, that can
be more of an asset than for me to love to stick to procedures.
If I resent procedures or they're in my way, then I will have
chosen slow growth. I will have chosen tardiness. I will have
chosen rebellion. And sometimes influences would have us resent
so much of a design given to us.
<p>
Here I have to go back to the astronaut illustration, because
an astronaut could resent all of the procedures given on a spacecraft.
If they say, "All the crew is going to do this at 2 o'clock
and this at 2<strong>:</strong>20 and this at...and we use the bathroom this
way, and you have to do it exactly this way, and <em>only</em> this
way while we're in this situation. In other words, we don't have
any choices, we use only this toothpaste, and only this do we
consume." Then they're crew members, and they can be a cog
in the wheel that doesn't have to be another color. Therefore,
it can fill any place where a spoke might go in the wheel because
they are so flexible, because that's the magic word for a crew
member. If I don't love procedures, I am retaining inflexibility.
I am reluctant to change. I am rebellious. So, procedures...we
have a zillion procedures. Sometimes we get instruction to update
them, and we'll go and examine what was the procedure we had for
this. And maybe it has been updated, what we had before was a
little outdated. So, once in a while, we do get instruction to
update, it's not that they're static. They change and they stay
with us as they are appropriate. I'll test you for a moment.
At a moment on the clock, at a given time, that's when their
head hits the pillow - that's when they're down. And they try
not to have it vary. I mean, they can't say, "Well, I'll
be there in another 5 minutes." They plan their time so
that go-down time is go-down time, that get-up time is get-up
time. That doesn't mean that if they need to go relieve their
bladder in the middle of the night that they can't do it, or they
have to wake somebody up in order to do it. But we have procedures
that help us demonstrate our crewdom, or our crewness, or our
identity as a crew member, instead of as individuals that want
the little freedom of doing this or that a little differently.
<p>
Now, it's true that one vehicle that might be a little smaller
might consume a little less than another vehicle, or depending
on how their vehicle processes fuel. We use the term "high
spenders" for vehicles that are high spenders of energy or
fuel, those who might need to consume a little bit more fuel.
So, they have to adjust their consuming some to adapt. Sometimes
we would say for this item on the menu and this item, we would
have so many cups of this or so many half-cups of this, except
"weight-gainers" might have this or this. That's the
way we receive procedures. And you say, "Goodnight, this
is structured!" Yes, it's structured, and I love it. (Laughs)
And, it's not that I enjoy being the instrument of giving out
these procedures, but these students love it. They've seen the
value. It does not restrict them. It frees them. But you have
to have been there to know what we're talking about. Otherwise,
you can easily doubt it. It liberates them. You'll have to learn
that if you come this way.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, is there a lesson in mimicking or copying our Older
Member?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Boy, we're hitting all the things that can run people away,
aren't we? (Laughs) Oh, goodness. Mimicking or copying our
Older Member. Boy, does that put your Older Member on the spot.
Yes, there is. I can remember when Ti would see a class member
copying someone else, and Ti would say, "If you want to copy
somebody, why don't you copy me"? And a human could hear
that - because she was saying that in reference to herself - and
say, "Good night! Who does she think she is"? And
yet she was saying it as an Older Member. She was saying, "I'm
your Older Member. I'm someone that hopefully has followed my
Older Member enough that if I have those things in place in my
behavior, then you would have only to gain by doing what I do."
Not that she's bragging or saying, "Look at me, I'm such
a perfect individual and if you follow me, you'll be so perfect."
It's that "I have been given a gift of learning from my
Father, which I will gladly share with you. And I know that what
I have learned required also that I discard all of my separate
ways. And the more I discarded, the more I saw that, 'Boy, I
wish I'd discarded these a long time ago, because the ways that
I learned from my Older Member were so much better than the ways
that I had - even in little, bitty things.'"
And you see the utility of them. You see the advantage of them. You see
the usefulness of them. So, yes, it gets right down to it's better
to...if you want to copy something, if you want to mimic something,
then why not choose someone who is ahead of you in the process
of discarding selfish thoughts or rebellion, or human behavior,
and try more to follow the lead of procedures and ways, and even
new habits from someone who's illustrating that position?
<p>
Now, it puts the spotlight on your teachers. It puts them in
a pretty exposed position, and they like exposed positions. Because
we all like exposed positions. Listen, I learn new lessons every
day. I expose new things every day. My Older Member shares with
me correction every day. And I hope that the options for my growth
are unlimited. If you think that anyone in our Father's Kingdom
has <em>arrived</em>, you are under a misconception. Certainly
not from their point of view. Each one of the members of our
Father's Kingdom only relates to himself as being the youngest
member and they look at everything above them as where they're
going. And therefore, they have everything ahead of them. They
don't think, "Boy, look where I've gotten. I'm up here"!
From their perspective, if they're serving some students, or
they're trying to help some students, that's almost a side issue,
because even that task of serving those students is a part of
mimicking your Older Member, learning from your Older Member,
who has served in that capacity before. And you haven't. Therefore,
if you don't constantly ask your Older Member, you're going to
get off track. They're the ones that have the experience. They're
the ones that have received the instruction. And they're the
ones assigned to give you the instruction.
<p>
A member of the crew just stepped up with the 2-minute sign for
this session, and I'm going to ignore it and we're going to proceed,
and just continue until we have covered these things on our list.
Who's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I think I was, yes. What about someone who's too old
or too young to start the process? Did I hear you say that souls
don't age like vehicles?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, that's a double-barreled question. Of course, in order
to ask that question, she has to be talking about vehicles, not
souls. We'll come right back to that, but whether or not souls
age...souls age only in the sense that if a soul goes in one
direction, it can eventually become nothing and therefore die.
If it goes in another direction, and goes into our Father's House,
it gets into an ageless condition. But only as long as it sustains
its position. It can get into our Father's Kingdom and still
be corruptible - it can still go the wrong way, like Lucifer did.
So, the potential of choice exists even in our Father's Kingdom,
and a soul can lose its agelessness. It can then have to do all
kinds of artificial things to try to maintain it, and it might
lose vehicles and have to take other ones, just like they do in
the human kingdom, which isn't the case in our Father's Kingdom.
Now, what was the front part of that question again?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> What about someone who's too old or too young to start
the process?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay. Too old or too young as far as a vehicle is concerned.
I believe that our Father's Kingdom has, in all fairness to any
soul that is deserving of any information that has a timetable
on it, that our Father's Kingdom sees that that soul is in an
appropriate age vehicle, or a vehicle that can receive that information.
If even hypothetically that soul is in a young vehicle that might
be too young for this experience, or the individual might worry
because they are about to lose their vehicle, and they have a
lot of our Father's Mind in them, our Father's certainly not going
to consider them waste. They would be put aside until they have
this opportunity to do it again.
<p>
But if you take this information with the idea, "Oh, so
I get this chance again in the future," then that gets a
bad mark on your readout, because that's not the way we proceed
closer to our Father. We don't make the choice of putting off
what we could do in relationship to moving closer to our Father.
But in order to help us understand that our Father's very fair,
our Father's Kingdom is very fair - they relate to souls. They
would never be so unfair as to have a deserving soul miss out
just because of the age of the vehicle that it might be wearing.
It would either receive the information at another time, or let
one or another influence take over that vehicle, and the soul
would then take over a vehicle that was the right age. This might
be a little hard to comprehend, but the possibility exists that
a soul could be relating to a vehicle, and, our Father's Kingdom,
who alone has the right to do this (even though Luci tries to
do it all the time - take over vehicles and shove the spirit out
to the extent where that vehicle doesn't belong to them anymore)
our Father's Kingdom, who does have the right to, could actually
take a soul out of the vehicle and other spirits would take it
over, it would continue to live, and the people who knew it would
say, "What happened to that child, or that old person, because
that's not the same person any longer." And then that soul
would move into another vehicle that was still healthy mentally
or of sufficient age, and suddenly the ones who were identifying
with that vehicle would say, "What in the world happened
to that person? They're <em>changed.</em> What is all this preoccupation
with this overcoming the world, or this "being born again,"
whatever it is that has happened to them. So, it can happen in
a number of ways. There's nothing to fear as far as age of vehicle,
whether it be too young or too old. Our Father's Kingdom takes
care of that. That's part of their activities.
<p>
What's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I was wondering, what about some of the prophecies, like
the 144,000? The Raptures? Incarnations?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> (Laughs.) Goodness alive! I can see why this might be the
wrap-up meeting, because we're going to get into things that are
really going to cause them to throw arrows at us, if we say much
about them. Maybe we just shouldn't say anything (laughs). Oh,
goodness! The only thing that has been shared with us, and I
don't know how accurate it is, but we'll share a little bit with
you. As far as 144,000 is concerned, whether or not that's an
accurate number or means anything, I certainly don't know. It
may be. How that works, I wouldn't know if it was an accurate
number. As far as who it represents, if it does in fact represent
those overcomers, then I'm afraid that that number then applies
either realistically or symbolically to you, you who are about
to overcome - you who, at the end of this Age, are about to move
into our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
As far as raptures are concerned, there's a lot of debate as
to whether or not raptures even exist. And what is a rapture?
Some say, "Well, that only happens after taking a spiritual
body." But what is a spiritual body?
If you have gone with the spirit or the mind of our Father's Kingdom
and you have been lifted out of the world, and one interpretation
of rapture is "lifted out,"...I don't know if this is
true or not. It doesn't really matter. It isn't significant
to us. It's no basis for our allegiance to our task. And it
shouldn't be to you. If you can think of it in that light, and
just simply be amused by it, because we're not trying to lock
in on what we're doing with fulfillment of the prophecies in the
Book of Revelation, or Isaiah, or anyplace else, or Daniel. But
to me, just for fun, when we got the instruction to take the class
out of the world, literally lifted them out of the world, went
into isolation where nobody could find them, they didn't exist
as far as the world was concerned. And even if they took a job
once in a while to bring in a few sticks to try to buy some hamburgers,
or whatever it was, they didn't relate to anybody in the world.
They only went to that job, went right back to their isolation,
and that remained that way for all these years. If anybody has
been lifted out or kept separate from the world for the time that
they received their overcoming, if that word can symbolically
apply to anyone, I certainly don't know why it wouldn't apply
to our class. So, if there's a first rapture, in that sense,
then I can't imagine that that isn't applicable to our class.
Like I said, it doesn't mean anything to us, we don't count on
it - it doesn't motivate us. And in the same sense, if there's
such a thing as a second rapture, which is more important to us
now, the possibility of that...because that would be you.
That would be <em>you</em> moving into your own overcoming, your
total separateness, your insistence upon not relating to the human
world.
<p>
In the same way, a couple of other terms in prophecy that are
referred to so much are "first resurrection" and "second
resurrection." They're just other terms for, in our head,
the same thing. Because, if the soul has come into life, if the
soul has moved into a vehicle and has taken over that vehicle,
and that soul itself is incorruptible and imperishable, whether
it loses the vehicle or not, then it has resurrected. It has
moved back into life a bit at a time. And that has happened certainly
to the class. That is ahead for those who might follow in their
path if they receive this information. And even though this touches
my heart to talk about this, and it touched my heart for your
sake, again I have to say we're not going to go out and try to
invite more arrows being shot at us and more daggers thrown our
way on the basis of fulfillment of prophecy. We do not <em>know</em>
the accuracy of this. We find it amusing.
<p>
You know, one time Ti and I went into a place...we were so moved,
because we thought we were going out to tell the Truth about the
Kingdom of Heaven and how to get from here to there, and if that
wasn't two witnesses, we didn't know who the Two Witnesses were.
We went into this place that was supposed to be a spiritual center
and, lo and behold, as we were sitting there waiting for the leader
of that spiritual center, a student was in the room with us and
started asking us some questions and said, "Well, what are
you all about? What's your information"? We started sharing
with that student a little bit, and she said, "Well, what
is it you're saying"? And out of our naivete, we
said, "Well, we think that we might be fulfilling the task
that was referred to as Two Witnesses in the Book of Revelation."
And this student just hit the ceiling because her two teachers
were the two witnesses. (Laughs) So, goodness alive, did that
do a number on our heads! We thought, "Gracious, we don't
want to do that again." And it's like, whether we were or
not, it was good for us to experience that. And so, from that
point on it didn't matter to us what the reality was. Who's going
to prove what the reality is, as far as who might be the fulfillment
of the application of certain prophecies of individuals?
<p>
Okay, what's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Why did Jesus say He was King of the Jews? And who are
the true Israelites? The overcomers?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, King of the Jews. Who are the Israelites? I'll try
to move quickly. If you really know the meaning of - the <em>old
</em>meaning in the Hebrew - of Israelites, or who the Jews really
were, the word meant "overcomers." So, to me, those
who overcome the world, those who move into this position are
the true Israelites, the true Jews, in that sense. Jews were
those representing the Israelites. Jesus was trying to relate
to them. He was saying, "We are the overcomers. We are
the rightful heirs. And I've been sent, so I'm serving in the
position as your King." Of course, by the time that the
humans heard that and went to the authorities and said, "That
guy is saying He is King of the Jews," all those who considered
themselves Jews and weren't students of His knowledge and didn't
know anything, then they would certainly want to condemn Him for
such things as that. But the Truth still exists today that the
true meaning of the word is "overcomers." Not that,
here again, it means that much to us. We've saved some of these
little questions that are kind of fun to examine, that don't mean
that much to us, for this last session. But those overcomers
are, in a sense, the true Israelites if they <em>do succeed</em>
in overcoming. You're not an Israelite if you haven't overcome.
It's just that is what you come into if you succeed at it.
<p>
Okay, what's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Did you want to touch on metaphysics, the occult?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Oh, boy. Metaphysics and the occult. Well, I have to say
a couple of little things here. Metaphysics is like an attempt
at interpreting what goes on in the transition from a human Age
condition to being out of the Earth's atmosphere, out of the human
Age. So, it could have application in our Father's Kingdom, but
even more so do we unfortunately believe that it is a counterfeit.
It is a tool used to get off the track. More common in the metaphysical
approach to truth is the concept of "Ye are gods, we are
hunting for that cosmic consciousness, we are hunting for that
Universal Mind, and we're not really that concerned with overcoming
the behavior that is not found in our Father's Kingdom."
So, in that sense, it's counterfeit - both the metaphysical and
the occult.
<p>
Now, there's one thing that I have to mention here. The people
say about little movements that happen, they say "They're
the occult!" You know, the only real meaning of the word
"occult" is "hidden." That's all it really
means. Unfortunately, if people try to derogatorily apply that
to us, our information has been hidden, but now it is being exposed.
Now that it is being exposed, it certainly isn't hidden. So,
the meaning has no meaning. A lot of people take terms that don't
really have any meaning, and they don't know what the meaning
of it is, and they try to apply them to things they don't like.
"That's satanic." Even though the ones calling others
satanic might be absolutely perfect servants of Satan in every
way, they're going to call others satanic, because out of their
ignorance, they don't know any better. And in the same way, they
would think of derogatory terms like "cult" and link it right
with "occult." "Cult, occult - same thing."
And we've acknowledged that if there ever was a cult or a culture
that was different, and unique, and unlike the world, and doesn't
have a place in the world, then we take the prize, I guess, of
being the cult of cults. And, I'm afraid, so did Jesus and His
disciples. There's no denying that.
<p>
So, okay, let's move on. What's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> What about the importance of mobility, short rentals?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, that's an important point that we missed in talking
to people as they try to prepare themselves a little bit. We
left that out when we were talking about the practical aspects
of moving out of your world, indebtedness, and charge cards, and
that kind of thing. If you are starting to move in the direction
of breaking your ties, then, and as anyone does that and tries
to do the applications right now, in realistic terminology you
ask yourself "What's it going to take for me to get from
here to there"? Then we have to move into a very mobile
condition where we can pick up at any moment. We can follow instruction
as it is given to us. We can't say, "Well, I can do that
if you just give me two weeks or if you just give me four weeks."
Therefore, we'll get our belongings down to necessities, then
whittle at them and whittle at them, and then get down to necessities,
then whittle at them and whittle at them...because our judgment
of necessities changes. Now, some might go to an extreme and
walk out the door with what they have on their vehicle, and then
it becomes somebody else's responsibility to have them wearing
something that isn't stinking to the high heavens. So, that doesn't
work too well either. We have to be practical and not just go
to extremes. But we do need to cut our excess down, our possessions
down, so that we have real mobility. Some forms of mobility are
having an RV, or something like that, or to be in an apartment
or a house that has a very short term, by the week or by the month,
hopefully at the most, so that you wouldn't lose money, or lose
much money, if you left prior to the completion of that month.
Certainly not a long-term lease and then just have to pick up
and leave. In this world, it's hard to find anything where they
will rent something pleasant to you on a short-term basis. You
have to work hard to find something that's short term, or either
work hard trying to convince them to rent to you for a short term,
telling them that you will take care of it and it wouldn't be
a waste of their money and effort. You might even do improvements
on it for the short term that you're there in order to interest
them in letting you stay there. Lodging has become too expensive
to rent a place like in a hotel or motel, for the most part, on
a temporary basis, or a short-term basis.
<p>
But, realistically, we have to get down to these little nitty-gritty
things. Okay? What else is on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, is it right that the soul that was in a human can
serve humans better from a Kingdom Level above them?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> This question came up because it seemed to help some of the
students a lot when (I think on our last tape) we were talking
a little about how a dog who relates to a human is moving out
of his dog world and only wants to connect with the human world.
Now, in the same respect, a dog can't learn much from other dogs.
He can learn from humans, if he's moving up, if that spirit can
move up, in that respect. Wouldn't it also be true that if I'm
moving into my Father's Kingdom that I can't continue to live
in the world? I have to move into my Father's Kingdom in the
same way. I have to isolate myself, not participate in that world.
I have to isolate only with members of my Father's Kingdom that
can help. Some can say, "Goodness, how can you justify not
continuing with human, humanitarian acts and charitable acts,
and taking responsible positions in your community"? The
same parallel would exist, "Well, how could a dog not be
a good dog and good example for the other dogs in that community,
and try to raise their standard." That's fine! That's exactly
what he should do, until the time that he is reaching for more.
Then he leaves those dogs, he migrates to the human, and he starts
on the process of trying to please only them. The same is true
in the human relationship to our Father's Kingdom. What's next
on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, did you want to discuss something about race?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Oh, it's funny that you should ask (laughs). You know, this
student had to go through recognizing that he could in a sense
be the only racist in our classroom at times when he was dealing
with wondering if everybody else might be a racist. Can you see
that if he has a consciousness of thinking that others could be
prejudiced against him, then he is prejudiced due to his imagination
of their prejudice. He is the one then who has color consciousness.
And that influence would have him think that "If people
are coming down on me or if they're singling me out, or if everybody's
bringing up things that I need to work on, then could it have
some bearing on the fact that my skin is a different color"?
And certainly influences would have him try to think in that
way. And he recognized that here, as influences would like to
have him recognize others as maybe being racist, or maybe having
prejudice, that he was the only one who he had evidence of being
racist, in a sense, because race consciousness is racist. It's
so ridiculous for any minority group to want equal time, want
no inhibiting factors placed upon them, whether it be gays, or
women's rights, or other races. And yet, they are the ones, by
their mere preaching, that insist on that consciousness. If I
am a black person who is insisting on black rights, then I am
the racist. I am reminding you that I am black. I cannot overcome
racism, nor can anybody who I am dealing with overcome racism,
until I literally become color blind. And the same thing is true
in dealing with differences of other types. Until I become blind
to those other types, only then can I lose any prejudice. If
I sustain any consciousness of that kind of prejudice, then I
become the instigator of prejudice. So, it doesn't make a bit
of sense. We have to become color blind. Listen, in our Father's
hot house, the plants have got all kinds of colors, and He likes
them all. He never said, "I don't like that one."
If He didn't like it, He would have done away with it. He likes
<em>all</em> of those different plants and their possibilities and
their potentials. What He doesn't like is if the <em>soul</em>
within those plants wants to go away and work against Him, but
He even permits them to do that. But nobody's as color blind
as our Father's Kingdom certainly.
<p>
I'll turn that around and say instead of being color blind, our
Father sees the <em>value</em> in all of that, but sees it all as
plants, sees it all as His creation, sees it all as demonstration
of it. I'm afraid when we move into our Father's Kingdom, we
don't know how many colors there might be. Probably the colors
that there might be of our vehicles would be one that none of
us has ever worn, and they might also be alike, and therefore,
we have to have color-blind consciousness.
We don't want to have any favoritism or any negativity
toward anything relating to how tall or how short or how fat or
how skinny, or certainly what color skin. That's beneath us.
<p>
Okay, what's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, is it possible that the rumored approaching planetoid
is from our Heavenly Father's Kingdom?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Oh, I don't know if we ought to spend any time on that or
not. There's been a little rumor that there's a planetoid approaching
this planet, and certainly the possibility exists that it could
be approaching for the reality of this spading time that we have
talked about. And at that, I'm going to stop our questioning
and move into our punch line, move into our finale, if we can,
in humor, discuss it that way.
<p>
<strong>I think that the most difficult thing that I have to deal
with and that these students have to deal with and that you have
to deal with, as someone potentially who's coming this way, is
the acceptance of us in that relationship with you. In other
words, the place that Satan has worked the hardest is to have
you very reluctant to accept anyone as a Representative of our
Father's Kingdom.</strong> It's like the last thing you want to do
is be a cult member. The last thing you want to do is to go off
with some weirdo and to fall in some trap or fall out of what
is considered to be the norm. We were in that same head space
before we started.
<p>
I have to give you an analogy. I saw a movie not long ago, and
it's not completely an accurate analogy, but in the movie, an
individual realized that an inheritance was coming up in this
family, and the individual appeared on the scene as the one they
thought was dead from before - so many years had passed - and
the person reappears on the scene and says, "I am so and
so." It would have put that person in a position to receive
that inheritance. Now, in that particular movie I believe that
the person really wasn't an heir, but it still had a good ending
anyhow. Let's say that person <em>was</em> the major heir in that
particular inheritance. And let's say that nobody else knew that,
but the person who was the heir knew that he was the heir. What
is he to do about it? That individual, knowing he is the heir,
turns to the others and offers it to them saying, "I have
this inheritance to give to you. I have prepared this place for
you. I have this whole world waiting for you, and I want to give
it to you." Well, I know that's true in my case. You don't
know it, I know it. How do I know it? Because I know my Older
Member. Now, I don't want to get emotional here. I <em>know</em>
my Older Member. I know that my Older Member <em>is </em>my Older
Member. In the beginning of this task, I worked hard against
that. I didn't want to accept that. It was an infringement upon
me. It was as difficult for me to accept my Older Member as my
Older Member as it was for these students to go through accepting
me also as an Older Member, and as it will be for you, should
you accept them as Older Members and me as older Older Member.
But when I did persist, when I stayed with it until I could know
my Older Member, then I knew that this was my family. And that
when it was time to go home, back to my family, that it was a
real home, and the inheritance was there. And it was for me.
<p>
What's awkward here is that if we did not speak to you (i.e.,
put out this information), we wouldn't lose out. Our inheritance
is still there, but you would not have even had a chance to become
rightful heirs. In that case, you would never get these tapes.
The inheritance didn't come, that we're aware of, with a tag
on it that says it can't be given to us unless we involve someone
else. But there's a problem that exists here, because part of
what came with the knowledge of our family and its ways, and its
inheritance, was also the knowledge that there might be other
rightful heirs. There might be other sons. Now, would we come
before you, would we put this information out if we were not interested
in your possible relationship as an heir. What have we to gain
by putting it out for any other reasons? We get ridicule, blasphemy,
scorn, everything...we have nothing to gain by putting this
out. Part of the mind that is in us says, "If you can be
rightful heirs, if our family wants us to let the information
out and to try to find out if there are rightful heirs, how can
we refuse that"? Can we say, "No, I don't want to put
myself in that position, I don't want to accept that ridicule
or jeopardy"? Therefore, I must accept that I am an heir,
if I'm to offer any of that Kingdom to other heirs. They must
accept that. Now, if you're going to be an heir, you have to
unfortunately be put in the position of accepting that relationship
through someone who delivers the little message. You know, it's
like Publishers' Clearinghouse, as they issue out who's going
to be the $10 million winner, except this is a zillion times more
valuable than that. We <em>know</em> that the truth we're saying
to you is true. You don't know it. We can't expect you to know
it. You're still looking at it. You're still examining it.
You can know it. You can know it swiftly with our help, but you
have to accept the helpers.
<p>
The faster that you can lick the rebellion and run away the doubt
and take those steps, the sooner you move into your own sobriety,
the sooner you see that picture. Because that picture in a sense
is our proof. We know it. It's like we've been delivered a certificate
that says proof to us of our Father's House, of our place in it,
of our inheritance, and that proof cannot come to you unless you
take each step along the way, the way that they have designed
it. You have to take it from another heir who has come into that
position. So, we know the spot you're in. We know the spot we're
in. And it's a tough spot for both of us. We know how hard it
is for you to accept us, but we know that if you're going to be
the beneficiary, you're going to have to accept us. We went through
the same thing. We've dealt with it. The amount of effort that
you put into attempting to accept and believe us will equal the
degree of your own reputation in the world being jeopardized.
<p>
Goodness, if I could take back the times that I doubted my Older
Member. Because from where I sit, I know, I know who my Older
Member is. I know the truth that was given to me. My Older Member
gave it to me. Look, my Older Member even sacrificed time in our
Father's Kingdom to come and be on this task. Certainly didn't
have to. And to reach out and awaken me and to bring me into
that knowledge, and even say, "Well, look, we're partners,
let's think of ourselves as partners in this task" - my Older
Member didn't have to do that. It was for my sake that my Older
Member did that. And then when it was time for my Older Member
to move back into that Kingdom, it would always be for more lessons
for me, for my sake, to experience my Older Member dropping a
vehicle, and my having to relate to my Older Member in a different
manner. It was for my sake and for these students' sake, and
for your sake. I know. I know nothing else. Nothing else means
anything to me. And I don't want this to sound like a hard sell,
but I know that it can sound that way. If you had actually received
the certificate of your place in that inheritance, and it also
said, "If you would deliver this to possible other heirs,
then they can also receive it."
So, we're in that position with you. And we
hope that this whole series can be the beginning of your finding
that place in our Father's Kingdom, that is so precious to you.
It's not an easy road. It's the toughest road that can be found.
<p>
We have no idea how the world would respond to any of us or what
they will do with us. That can't be a factor here. We know that
nothing can happen to our souls, and our souls are all that matter.
Any inconvenience that we are put to or any interruption or interference
or irritation, we can endure if it's part of what goes with the
task. Not that our Father's Kingdom would have it be a part,
but our Father has not yet done away with this other kingdom,
and they who unknowingly serve the Luciferians have the option
to act against us, and to work as hard against us as they can.
We recognize that and we're prepared for it. It would even be
a difficult thing for you to do from your relationship with that
world. They would look at you, even though their main dagger
would be pointed at this vehicle and then at these vehicles and
then lastly at you, they would wonder what on Earth has happened
to you for you to be so crazy as to do such a thing. They may
live to see the physical presence of our Father's Kingdom and
all this harvest happening and not know where they're going or
what the sorting out is that's applicable or appropriate for them.
We know where we're going. We know what's happening here at
the end of the Age for us, and what may happen for you if you
go this way. And we'll do the best that we can to follow our
Older Member's lead and assist you to travel as fast as you can.
And we know that if you believe with all your might and you're
on that route, that nothing can happen to you. We are concerned
for you. If you want us to assist you, then that's an action
that you must take. Thank you.
