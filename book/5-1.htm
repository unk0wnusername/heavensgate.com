<font size=+6>T</font>his section opens with two documents previously unreleased to the public,
and written in the "Star Trek" vernacular briefly mentioned in the
preface.  In our attempts to relate to the public, we were always
experimenting with contemporary ways to express our information that could
potentially override traditional religious, as well as "New Age,"
preconceptions and stereotyping.  But of significantly greater importance
to our overall task, this section also contains one of our most powerful
statements - <strong><em>"UFO Cult" Resurfaces with Final
Offer</em>.</strong><p>

Our most aggressive venture yet, as far as the public was concerned, began
on May 27, 1993, when we published, at our own expense, this 1/3-page
statement of our thinking and beliefs in <strong><em>USA TODAY,</em></strong> in
both their national and international editions.  Between June and
September of that same year, we published a slightly modified version of
the statement in over 20 weekly and monthly alternative newspapers and
magazines in the U.S., Australia, and Canada.  As we stated earlier, our
understandings are constantly being updated as our circuitry adapts to
higher perspectives.  As a prime example of this, on page 4 of Section 6
we have included the final version of the same statement, entitiled
<strong><em>Last Chance to Advance Beyond Human</em></strong> (which is
what the original <strong><em>USA TODAY</em></strong> statement evolved to).
This later version was distributed at the meetings we held across the
country in 1993 - 1994.<p>

Also included in this section is one of the few documents in this book not
actually written by our Teachers - <strong><em>Total Overcomers Classroom
Admission Requirements</em>.</strong>  As is stated in the paper, it was
sent to those who, as a result of reading our statement and/or receiving
follow-up materials, were seriously considering joining the class.<p>
