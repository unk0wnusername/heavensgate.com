<strong>
Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 8
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr>

Welcome to Session 8. I'm assuming you've just watched Session
7, or you remember still what was on it. We told you then that
we're redoing both Sessions 7 and 8 because of some things that
we learned in the process that we needed to correct. We're also
redoing 7 and 8 pretty much back to back, the same way we did
them yesterday.
<p>
I want to share with you a little bit of intimate information,
because this is Christmas Day, and we're together - at least
most of our classroom. For the most part, we're in one place
and working on these sessions at this time. We'll have our experiment 
- or our consuming - together later in the day to be able to
spend a little time together. I'm going to ask the cameraman
to pan across these members of the classroom who are over to the
side, as I talk for a moment, because I want you to get just a
moment's glance at some of the class that's sitting there. They
look pretty sober, don't they? (Laughter) Pan them once more
and maybe they'll crack their faces. You need to get up on their
faces instead of their knees. There, get where we can see their
faces. Try that once again.
<p>
Okay, you can come back to me now. The reason I wanted them
to do that was to also let you in on the fact that we had a little
meeting in the wee hours of the morning, discussing our update
and the reason that we wanted to re-do Sessions 7 and 8. I also
asked them, since we are together today, to sit in with us in
this recording session and for them to assist me by asking that
nothing come out of this mouth, or this vessel, or this vehicle
that isn't from Ti's mind, coming through Ti, and from our Father's
mind, Ti and Do's Father's mind, as it flows through Ti and through
this vessel. If they concentrate on that and help me by remembering
that, then maybe we'll be less likely to enter into subject matter
that is unnecessary or irrelevant or not on the subject.
<p>
To follow through from Session 7, we spoke fairly directly and
personally with you as listeners at the end of that session. 
In order to pick that up, I'm going to dive right in and be personal
with you again. I guess I realize what a <em>big jolt</em> it is
to your system, even though you might have identified with it,
close to the end of that last tape, as we spoke of the "elect,"
and as we spoke of those who are returning in order to complete
their overcoming and enter our Father's Kingdom. Even though
you identified with that, we have to also face the fact that as
you think of other things and you do other tasks, that identification
begins to fade. And the forces and thoughts of this world have
you question, "Goodness, have I lost my mind"? and "What
is going on"? and "I'm not sure I need to watch that
next tape because I could be going down a dangerous road."
Part of the aspect of "shortening the days" at the
end - or making whatever classroom might be remaining a <em>short</em>
classroom instead of a longer one as we had - means that
the many tests we were put through, or this classroom was put
through over the years, you're going to be put through in a very
compact, accelerated period of time. And I know that it's going
to be hard on your systems and difficult for you to make the adjustment.
But I'm going to go right ahead and even bring up another aspect
of it that will make it even more difficult for you. In a sense,
it might make it easier for you, because we're facing the facts,
we're getting right down to reality.
<p>
If in fact we are seeing that as our Father's Kingdom relates
to the human kingdom, and as the history books tell us, they relate
on a basis of <em>knowing through faith.</em> And because they
can't have us motivated by proof, we have to <em>believe</em> in
them. If you come this way, if you correspond with us or you
let us know that this is something that you must do and you want
to start identifying with us, as wanting to be a child in that
Kingdom and wanting to rid yourself of your humanness, then you're
very quickly going to also realize that you're going to be, in
a sense, submissive. You're going to kind of present yourself
as putty in our hands because we're representing that Kingdom.
And I know this is one aspect of it that is hard to adjust to.
In a sense, you have to face right now and continue to face,
"Do I really believe that this individual on that camera
and these students of that individual, are they really vessels?
Are they really of our Father's Kingdom? Are they functioning
that way? Is the information that is coming through them that
information that I can recognize as from my Heavenly Father's
Kingdom? Can I see the pieces of the puzzle falling together?
Is it speaking to me? And if it is speaking to me, then I have
to also accept the more difficult realization that this is going
to mean that I'm also going to have to get out of a situation
where I'm simply watching this tape and <em>do</em> the things that
this is going to begin to require as we get more into the specifics
with you. And so I have to really look very carefully and examine
my own belief."
<p>
When Jesus said, 'If you <em>believe</em> Me, all those that believe
on Me, and come <em>through</em> Me to My <em>Father</em>, <em>He</em>
can offer you His Kingdom.' This is the same thing. I mean,
you're being put to the test of, "Can I recognize this classroom
and this individual that's on the camera as from that same Household
that Jesus represented, <em>from that same Household</em>"?
It doesn't require any more of you than that. Certainly, I'm
not pretending to identify as anything other than a member of
that Household, and I know that I'm of that Household. But the
question is, do you know that I'm of that Household? And if you
don't, I don't want to talk you into it. It's a good time for
you to put away those tapes or put them in the garbage can if
you don't know that. Because now <em>you're</em> being put to the
test<strong>:</strong> "Do I recognize this information? If I do recognize
this information and the information seems true, then I have to
accept the packaging. I have to accept the "vessels"
as being chosen from that Kingdom to serve in this function."
<p>
In reality, that means that I'm actually going to take instruction
from these students and from the one that said, "I'm Do."
And that instruction is going to get down to specifics and be
very literal and very mundane, and is going to give me help in
ways I never thought would be necessary in an overcoming process.
I mean the "spelling out" of the menu that I might
consume, or the objects that might be purchased to use to brush
my teeth with, and when I bathe, and how often.
<p>
One of the helpers here brought up that the way I discussed partnerships
might be confusing to you - you might think that partnerships
go into the bathroom or to the clean-up area as a partnership,
which, of course, they don't. But I just remembered they had
mentioned that the way I expressed it, you might have thought
that they did, and so we're clarifying that.
<p>
The point is, we're going to get down to the nitty gritty with
you. If you come this way and you start asking questions, we're
going to answer your questions. You're going to have to realize
how mundane those questions actually get, and you're going to
say, "Well, does it mean that maybe it would be more right
to also wear loose-fitting clothing and not do the other things
that we had discussed and..."? Yes, you're going to be tested
with, "Can I accept instruction about the particulars from
these"? That's a <em>very</em> difficult hurdle.
<p>
Look at how many <em>very, very</em> religious individuals had
trouble when Jesus came and said, 'It is the Father Who speaks
through Me, and I can take you if you follow Me. If you believe
what He says through Me, if you believe the words that come out
of My mouth, and if you're a disciple of Mine, I'll get you there.'
The ones who had the most trouble with it were the ones who were
the most religious, because they couldn't accept the packaging.
Because the packaging that Lucifer had sold them was so tainted
and so "Old English," and so wrapped in such spiritual
packaging that it was unrealistic. It was like it had to be fulfilled.
It was like wanting the bells to ring and the Heavens to move,
and to be the beginning of a Spielberg film, something that really
showed all the miraculous aspects. It certainly couldn't be somebody
sitting on a video tape telling me that they've come from the
Kingdom of Heaven to help me get there, and that in order to get
there, I'm going to have to literally and actually face all the
little things, the little habits that I have, and change them
in order to be a crew member and learn what crew membership really
is. And, yes, that is where we are.
<p>
And as we go through more particulars in this session and the
next one - if there is a next one - you need to examine
your mind set and your willingness to yield, because our interest
is<strong>:</strong> this must be done quickly. Therefore, we know we're being
used in the way we are presenting this information. We know we're
being used to shorten those days. And that also puts the responsibility
on those who might be beneficiaries of this to move very, very
quickly, and be put to tests that might have taken us months or
years to be put to. You'll be put to many of those tests in a
very, very short time. So, we understand the trauma of it, and
we'll help you with the trauma if you <em>seek</em> help in the
trauma of it. But we have to also warn you and prepare you for
some of these particulars.
<p>
Who's next? Are you next on our question list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Yes, did you want to talk more about crew consciousness
and about breaking the habit of having something when you want
it?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes, the little saying that we say there, which is a big demon
that we have to deal with<strong>:</strong> "wanting what I want when I want
it." That sounds kind of funny and like a play on words,
but it is a very real demon that most of us have to deal with
in overcoming. And we want to try to help you understand what
the reward is in overcoming that <em>wanting what I want when I
want it. </em>A parallel we can use in approaching that issue
is the astronaut program in the human space program, or NASA's
program.
<p>
It wouldn't work too well if the Atlantis goes up on a mission,
and they have a lot of experiments to do, and certain members
of their crew have to knock out or omit certain experiments because
the experiments require that they consume certain items (or "eat" 
- we use <em>consume </em>to mean "eat"). If they consume
these items and certain members of the crew say, "I have
a funny stomach and I can't consume those items." So, we
have to knock out or omit that person then because he's not sure
that he could handle the freeze-dried or the powdered formula,
or whatever it is that they're going to be put to. And then another
crew member might say, "Well, I get so sleepy I just can't
stay awake when it gets to be 10 pm Earth time." We take
him out of another test that can be done only at a period that
might be registering on Earth as midnight. So, when we're getting
rid of <em>what-we-want-to-do-when-we- want-to-do-it</em>, it's
really the opposite. We're liberating ourselves from structure
that is there because of our habit - because of influences
that we have listened to that said, "I need <em>this</em> and
I want that. I'm a morning person, or I'm a night person, or
I mainly eat heavier foods in the morning, and I don't eat <em>those</em>
kinds of foods or..." - all these ideas we have of <em>we</em>
<em>like things our way - </em>we have to have them a certain way.
The word here that we have to put in flashing neon light is <em>flexibility</em>.
To become a good crew member, we have to have <em>flexibility</em>
- so flexible, that whatever instruction is given to the crew,
we can easily move into, even if it's "sit in a waiting mode."
We can't say, "Well, I'm so impatient at times when we have
to wait that at least give me some reading material. I can't
just sit. And if I have that reading material, the lighting is
so poor in here, I'm afraid I might have eye strain so...."
All these ideas we have of what <em>we need</em> in this circumstance
or that make us inflexible. If we're a good crew member, we are
extremely flexible. Most of the work, if not all the work, that
our Father's Kingdom does is done in crews and requires <em>extreme</em>
flexibility on the part of the crew. It fits right in with what
we talked about in our last session in also working against identity,
working against separateness, working against uniqueness, working
against anything that is still of the human kingdom.
<p>
Therefore, if what is of our Heavenly Father's Kingdom is manifest
to us in mundane ways, as instruction for a crew of what a crew
might do, what their schedule might be, what they might consume
in any particular given period of time, it's not as humans look
at the Kingdom of God and think<strong>:</strong> "If this is given to someone
to consume, then it must be morally or the <em>Godly way </em>to
consume." Here again, it's that "Old English"
and that fancy packaging or that spiritual approach to it. They
can't think of the Kingdom of God as being very practical, very
realistic, and just facing issues as tasks come up. Now, if we
receive instruction for a crew, then the crew, if it's going to
work together, has to be made up of several appendages of the
crew as a whole so that they look to each other and they don't
trust their own judgment. They say, "What about this? Is
this a cup and a half of this? Is this a level tablespoon of
that? Is this three inches of that"? They don't trust their
own judgment, because they know they can see things wrong, they
can be inaccurate. So, part of crew procedure then becomes having
a check partner, someone to check with. And that always extends
- that partnership then checks with another partnership, and so
forth. So, whenever they feel that the task cannot be stopped
trustworthily at that moment of checking, then they go to a greater
moment of checking, or greater extension of checking.
<p>
So, think long and hard about this business of all the ramifications
of <em>what I want to do, when I want to do it</em>, and how that
<em>limits</em> me - how that restricts me, how that knocks
me out of being able to serve with a flexible crew that has an agenda,
a task to perform.  And in our Father's Kingdom,
the particulars about that task aren't all given up front. In
fact, very little is given up front. They get one phase at a
time and when it's completed, then their crew chief says, "We're
ready for the next phase, if you're ready for us to perform the
next phase." And then the next phase comes in. The phase
may be just one little instruction given at a time, and if the
crew members start questioning it, "Well I don't see why
that's necessary." Ohhhh! Then pretty soon we're not really
believing that it is crew function that we're developing here.
We're interpreting it at a different level. We're trying to
look at it from what it means to <em>me</em>. "It interferes
with <em>me</em>." "I'm not sure I like that," or
"I'm not sure I really believe that that's what we're working
on here." And I'm afraid that all of us are put to that
test again and again and again. 
<p>
Is that really what these procedures are for? I don't know if
we've discussed it, but our procedures change and they change
and they change. Our diet changes and it changes and it changes.
Our time of scheduling things changes. Our partnerships change
and change. What we can count on is <em>change</em>. And it comes
pretty rapidly. Change gives us new opportunity to be more <em>flexible</em>
- that neon word - and so that a crew member can function well
as just an appendage, or, as we use the illustration, as a cog
in a wheel or a spoke in a wheel. If the wheel has a function
to perform, then one spoke shouldn't sing louder than another
spoke, or require certain attention that other spokes don't require,
or have in its mind something different. It may not understand
what the wheel is even performing. But if its head is in a right
place, it doesn't even question what the wheel is performing.
It says, "I can see here that we're performing a function.
I may not understand it, but it's not my place to question it,
and I know that I'll be more inclined to be in a position where
I can serve if I stop questioning, because then I'm not muddying
the air." I don't know if we've discussed it, because I
keep getting confused about what we covered in Sessions 7 and
8 that we discarded, but we have to bring up here the issue of
telecommunication, because...Is that the term?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Telepathy?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Telepathy, telepathy. Funny things come out of my mouth.
I realized in listening to one session that I had said "an
<em>on-hands </em>experiment," when I meant to say, "<em>hands-on</em>
experiment." And I think in the sessions that we did yesterday,
one came out, "Well I don't know what kind of <em>rat pack</em>
you are," meaning <em>pack rat. </em>So, a lot of things come
out backwards and we have to turn them around and try to adjust
them.
<p>
Mental telepathy is a <em>human</em> definition for a kind of communication
that is common in our Father's Kingdom. And the reason we have
to bring it up to discuss it is to point out that we're not saying,
"Oh, isn't that neat that members of our Father's Kingdom
can communicate mentally." We're not saying that mental
communication is the only communication. There's a funny little
thing that we can look at here. We may not have seen that this
piece of the puzzle fits in here, but when Jesus said, 'If you
even <em>look</em> at someone lustfully, you've committed the act.'
And you say, "How could that have anything to do with mental
telepathy"? It has everything to do with mental telepathy.
Because if I have a <em>thought</em> in my mind and I'm in our
Father's Kingdom, it is <em>expressed</em> at the moment that I
think it. It is expressed! And even though my Older Member or
the other crew members don't like to invade my privacy, they <em>hear</em>
my thoughts, because they have a communication of not having to
use their vocal chords and their tongues. And so, since that
is their behavior, that is their technique, that is a characteristic
of the suit of clothes that they wear, of their physical vehicle
that they wear, then we have to learn how to have <em>control</em>
of our brain, our tongue, our vocal chords. Mainly of our brain,
that we don't permit <em>thoughts</em> that would be negative or
doubting or periphery or unnecessary, or that could clutter the
air, because we're going to move into vehicles where thoughts
<em>are</em>, the moment a picture is formed.
<p>
You remember how in our last session we discussed that when a
picture is formed in our heads of the knowledge that our Father's
Kingdom has shared with us, that picture is so big and it's so
magnificent that it becomes evidence, it becomes proof to us of
the existence of our Father's Kingdom. It becomes a picture that
we can use to work with daily in our behavior, and that we can
refer to, to refresh our memory so that we don't have to doubt
the reality of our Father's Kingdom. In that sense, <em>faith</em>
presented that picture, then that became evidence that we could
utilize. So, all this is interrelated and connected up.
<p>
We're sharing with you several little different ways of looking
at the same picture at this moment. So, mental telepathy is a
very important aspect of crew participation - not letting
thoughts enter our mind that can be an interference, knowing that
our Older Member can read that thought. I mean, if we have that
thought, it comes right to them. So, we don't want to be screaming,
"Oh I don't understand what's going on here!" in our
thoughts. "Why don't you explain to me what I'm doing here.
You told me to do so and so, but you didn't tell me why."
And so pretty soon we become as a child or an interference that
really is not ready for that crew activity. We have to be put
in more of a remedial situation because of our needless questioning
and lack of trust and needing of attention, needing of explanation.
It's something that we need to consider. Where do we go from
there?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I was wondering back in Session 6, I think when
we left off we were talking about some of the particulars, the
techniques, of overcoming sensuality, and I thought we wanted
to go back to clothing - the costume that we wear and some
of the aspects of that.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Thank you for reminding me of that. And if I remember right,
we felt that when we were discussing costume or clothing that
we use in the classroom to try to abide by the principles of
how members of our Father's Kingdom would present themselves if
they had to wear the kind of vehicles that we are still wearing,
we left off, if I'm not mistaken, some little things that may
not be that significant, but we feel to mention them. Like we
mentioned double pockets. When we <em>can</em> buy shirts that
have double pockets, we would <em>prefer</em> to, though we don't
have a rule that says we can only wear shirts with double pockets.
You say, "Why double pockets"? Because it kind of
helps take the emphasis off of shape, particularly with a female
vehicle. If they have double pockets, it makes the vehicle less
obvious that it's a female vehicle. And if we're getting into
a non-gender mind place and behavior place where we don't want
to identify at a gender level, then double pockets is one little
thing that helps us with that. 
<p>
Another aspect of that same item is, where the length of our
sleeves or our trousers might be. We've said they're loose fitting,
and we don't draw them together at the waist. We don't like for
shape to be accentuated or exposed.
We're more comfortable if our arm is, for the most part,
not exposed. So, we'll wear our sleeve length either at the cuff,
or at the wrist, or turned back a time or two. That is easy and
doesn't expose that much of the arms. And we'd certainly be uncomfortable
in shorts or what a human would call a bathing suit. You're extremely
uncomfortable with this much exposure when you've wiped things
out of your memory and you're moving into a new behavior. I just
can't remember seeing a beach full of bathers in our Father's
Kingdom. It's just that it's beyond my imagination that that
would be behavior in our Father's Kingdom - to need to have
a bathing suit or to expose the vehicle in that way.
<p>
Another thing we've mentioned in that same respect was the sheerness
of a fabric, because if it's a sheer fabric, then it also has
a degree of exposure, so we make a point not to get things that
are too sheer. We have underclothes on both under our shirt and
under our trousers, and none of the females wear skirts 
- not that they're trying to look like males. It's just that
loose-fitting trousers, even though they might have come from the female
part of the department store, loose-fitting trousers and loose-fitting
shirts give us more of a genderless freedom when we don't have
to think about them. And they don't make us feel masculine or
feminine, because believe it or not, don't forget, males like
to wear tight clothing and tight shirts and tight blue jeans and
show off <em>their</em> curves as well, in kind of a ridiculous
way. We are doing everything that we can do to not identify with
a gender. Sheer, and I think there was even one other one - the
open collar is one other aspect that we pay attention to. It's
a trend in some human circles to open two or three buttons or
half way to the waist, and we're very uncomfortable with that
kind of exposure. It causes that particular individual to kind
of advertise their gender, and the last thing we want to do is
even be reminded of a gender. So, we would keep our collars buttoned
at the top, or if it's too tight at the top and there's a second
button near the top, then we'll use the second button. And if
that's not comfortable to us, we'll go to another shirt. But
these are all little finishing of details in talking about costume,
which we had covered in a previous session. What's next on our
list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> What about avoiding places that would tempt a vehicle,
like bars and clubs?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Wow! I know that it's important for us to mention this, but
these things are just so distant in our history to even think
about. But in yours, they're not that distant, because you might
go to places where you would subject yourself to vibrations where
people certainly wouldn't be that accepting of your discussion
of what you're about to do or ready to do. How could you be consistent
with your new mindset if you're in a bar or someplace where the
vibrations are that of intoxication, or thinking the kind of conversation
that goes on in a bar, whether it be of the NFL game or so-and-so's
pregnant or so-and-so is about to get married, did you know this
- gossip and all the kinds of conversation that is common in a
bar-like circumstance. The vibrations are so <em>beneath</em> us
that we would avoid them like the plague. I can't count the times
that we've gone into a place, even a restaurant or a movie that,
by looking at the advertisement, we thought it would be okay,
and we have to turn around and leave because we can't stand the
general feeling that is there. It's almost the unseen presence
that is there that seems to run us out. And we have to be willing
to get into a frame of mind where we don't mind walking out or
maybe going back up to the ticket office and saying, "I sat
in there for five minutes and that movie is not to my liking.
If I can get my money back, I would<strong>;</strong> otherwise, that's fine,
I'll leave." But I can't count the times that we have done
that at movie theaters or at restaurants or other places that
we might go. I'm afraid we've even visited churches where the
same thing has happened, where the thing that people would talk
about would sicken our stomach because it would be so unbecoming
to the instruction that we have received in our changeover from
the human kingdom to our Father's Kingdom. So, the answer is
yes, we avoid places that could pull us back into the world, and
we try to confine our places to things that are uplifting, at
least objective and not threatening to us. We don't try to subject
ourselves to tests unnecessarily, by saying, "Well, I've
outgrown that. I can handle that." We don't ever trust
that. We make a point not to trust it.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> What about the structure of partnerships? How is that
determined?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, that's a very, very useful tool in the classroom and
it's a very important topic to us.
<p>
Partnerships, partnerships, partnerships. They are valuable,
valuable, valuable. We told you a little bit ago how they can
change frequently. We've learned from experience that it helps
to have a partnership, since a partnership is two individuals
or sometimes three individuals who have asked their other partners
in that partnership to help them in their overcoming. They ask.
Part of a partnership is to involve the other person in assisting
you in your task of overcoming. Now if it can't be done in sincerity,
then it's a pretty lousy partnership. If I'm hesitant to ask
someone, or even if I'm hesitant to have anything brought to my
attention that I need to overcome, I don't know what I'm in this
classroom for. If I'm trying to overcome the world, then I want
all the help I can get and certainly a partnership is a place
where I can get help in my overcoming. 
<p>
It's true that in a partnership the members of that partnership
are in two's or three's. It's interesting, if you think in terms
of the New Testament, how Jesus sent his disciples out in two's
and three's because he knew it worked as a neat partnership. 
They do solicit from their partners, "If you see me do things
or even my countenance or little habit that I might have, a little
idiosyncrasy that I might have, or if I treat you in any way,
or I begin to gossip or anything that you observe about me that
is not the way that we have been taught and that is unbecoming
to members of our Father's Kingdom, I ask that you bring it to
my attention." But what if you're in a situation where one
partner is pretty sensitive emotionally and has a hard time dealing
with it if the other partner brings it up in a way that hurts
their feelings? Even though the one partner is trying to learn
not to respond that way and not be so easily hurt - they
have to get past that - on the other side of the fence, the person
who is not very diplomatic in bringing up something that needs
to be overcome has to work very hard at learning to be diplomatic
and also has to question their judgment department. "Am
I seeing a lot of things critically that maybe surpass our teaching
and our instruction, and maybe it's me, maybe it's still my humanness
that is finding fault here by some judgment at the human level,
instead of the way I've been taught by my Teachers or by my Older
Members." So, you can see all the ways that can work.
<p>
One aspect of a partnership that is so valuable is to not have
a partnership made up of two individuals that could easily fall
back into being attracted to each other at the human level or
in an emotional involvement or in a sensual involvement. I mean,
you see these students here - female/male. I'm sorry I said that
because they are <em>not</em>, but to appearances, their vehicles
are. And he still sees with his vehicle's eyes, even though he's
trying to train his eyes. If he lowered his vibrations, his eyes
could see a remnant of female vehicle, and vice versa. She could
see a remnant of male vehicle. And so it's an important factor
certainly, for the most part, not to place vehicles in a partnership
where they could affect one another in that way. These two students
are not partnered, even though they have been given tasks where
they are partnered for a period of time. They are partnered in
the aspect of serving as teleprompter and helping me in this task,
but when this task ceases or the session is over, or they're not
studying for the session, then they go back to their other partnership,
and their various partners might also be partnering for that period
of time. But I'm just trying to help you understand that we don't
put people in partnership situations that would test their overcoming,
or put it to the test unnecessarily. So, if I'm still dealing
with male/female attraction, even if I don't think I'm dealing
with it, but my teacher might realize that I'm still dealing with
it, then we wouldn't be partnered in a relationship where it's
male/female.
<p>
And we take all things into consideration as to how the vehicle
might have had its orientation, whether it was heterosexual or
homosexual. Because in our Father's Kingdom those words don't
mean anything different than orange or apple. I mean, they have
no more significance than that. They're two pieces of fruit 
- apple and orange - and as far as our Father's Kingdom is
concerned, they are two aspects of sensuality, reproductive activity,
side issues of the human kingdom that are completely inappropriate
- not therefore bad and ugly, but it's not done in our Father's
Kingdom, it's not needed. It's not a behavior that is there.
<p>
Remember, babies are not born in that Kingdom from a female's
womb. And remember, babies are born from the human kingdom as
adult humans and they become babes in that Kingdom. That's the
way that works. So, we do everything we can do to make a partnership
work. We don't like to put them to the test if, let's say, sometimes
partners might be so much of the same mind and have the same faults
and not be able to recognize those faults, that it doesn't work.
If one person is given to lack of restraint and being too boisterous
and is partnered with someone else who lacks restraint and is
too boisterous and careless, and they upset things not meaning
to, they can't really help each other that well because they don't
see those things. So, it helps to kind of calculate, and we get
instruction to calculate a partnership in areas that they can
be helpful to each other. And never can one partner cover all
the needs of another partner. That's part of the reason why partnerships
are frequently changed, in order to have us.... What are we trying
to become? <em>Flexible,</em> in neon sign, so that we can serve
as a crew member without having to require special attention or
having to deal with things. 
<p>
What's the next question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Can you talk about how death and disease - I guess this
is off of the subject of sensuality - but how death and disease
can bring you closer?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I think that we should address that because it can help us
understand. Well, let's take what we have talked about - how
in our Father's Kingdom death is not when the vehicle falls away.
When the vehicle falls away, it has little or no effect on the
spirit. And death applies only to the spirit, so when a vehicle
drops, it's not affecting the spirit. But humans use the term
to apply to when the vehicle falls. Now, there is a little bit
of something that happens when we lose the vehicle that can help
us. Frequently, when a person is traumatized because they're
about to lose their vehicle, they turn closer to God or they try
to clean up their act a little bit and examine whether or not
they are maybe going to their Creator, or that maybe this world
is over for them. Well, let's face it, there's not much time
in which they can make much significant change in their behavior
or their likes and dislikes or becoming a crew member, but they
can start trying to get a little closer in their consciousness
to their God. They can start to examine their values. Therefore,
when that spirit leaves that vehicle, that spirit would go into
the discarnate world with the consciousness it had when it left
its vehicle.
<p>
Death can be taken advantage of, in the same way as so-called
terminal disease puts us in the same thinking. We begin to question
how we're going to spend our time from here until the end of our
life, even though it isn't the end of our life. It's just the
end of that particular plant, which is very, very temporal, when
you think about it as a perennial. But it can be used to get
us closer. So that even AIDS or any contagious disease, any disease
that is big on the list or that humans might put in the category
of plague, can be thought of as a definite <em>positive</em>. Not
a positive in the way that it's getting rid of the "oranges"
(homosexuals), so to speak. You know, why are the "oranges"
so bad? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. It's a positive that
<em>any</em> disease can make us re-examine our values and make
us question, "Why am I in this position? Where's the positive
in this"? Is the positive to make me think, "Should
I be getting closer to my Heavenly Father? Should I become in
some people's eyes more <em>religious</em>"? This might be
a turning point. In some instances becoming more religious is
not a turning point in the right direction. It can be a turning
point in the wrong direction, because the religion they might
be turning to is so filled with misinformation. And where does
Lucifer like to put the strongest misinformation? In the religions
that should house the realistic heritage information of our Father's
Kingdom's relationship with this Age in this 6000-year period.
<p>
So, back to the question, death/disease, even though we know
it is not death, those two traumatic situations can serve in a
very good way to help a vehicle/spirit re-examine its condition.
"Why am I in this position"? Make a positive of that.
<p>
Okay, what's our next question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> What about attachments beyond the immediate family?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Attachments, like a best friend, or...?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Yes.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, it doesn't hurt us to examine that a little bit because
sometimes those attachments are as strong, if not stronger, than
attachments of the physical family, or the human family tree.
What <em>does </em>have bearing is, "I need to sever that
attachment if I'm going to make these my final days, if I'm going
to get out of the human kingdom." And it becomes hard to
sever. Sometimes there are relationships where you've been intimate
with someone, and they've been the person you always run to, to
cry on their shoulder or to tell them what you've experienced
or you just had a miscarriage, whatever it is that's traumatic
that you go and share with someone as your <em>confidant.</em> 
And it's easy to bring into a classroom that habit of needing
a confidant, or needing someone to have a close relationship with,
even though you may not be looking for a physical or sensuous
relationship. But in a sense, our Father's Kingdom says, "I'm
it. If you're going to get into My Kingdom, I have to be <em>it</em>.
<em> </em>I have to be satisfactory to you. What I offer you has
to be satisfactory. It has to be all you want. It has to offer
you enough."
<p>
And that becomes a difficult task. Because when you're trying
to overcome the desires that you previously had, it's hard to
find that vessel (that is given to you for the Kingdom of Heaven
to speak to you through) adequate supply for all of your needs,
until those needs are fairly well overcome and you have shifted
to a new set of needs. But that teacher, that vessel, can help
you shift, can help you make the adjustment so that you can go
through the weaning from those old needs and adopting new needs
and looking to the Kingdom of Heaven through that vessel. It
has to be done that way. I'm afraid Jesus warned us all of that,
that it has to be done that way. Someone has to be assigned that
position, and we have to accept the one that was assigned to that
position. And that individual has to be satisfying to us, adequate
to fill the bill of our needs. And that really puts the pressure
on that vessel, because that vessel knows that his Older Member,
or his Father more than fills the bill. So, the big question
or the big problem that we have to deal with is examining the
bill that needs to be filled. Does the bill need to be changed?
How much of the old bill is human? If it is, I have to strike
it out.
<p>
We don't want to stop asking. We want to know what our needs
are so that our asking does not decrease but increases. Our askings
for human things decrease, decrease, decrease until they are nonexistent,
and our asking of things of our Father's Kingdom increases and
increases. We said that a pump had to be put into the mechanism
in our free will and our choice so that our thirst increases.
And it only comes as we ask questions and as we pursue, and we
desire to become strong and <em>flexible</em> - a good crew member
that wants to be available for service. And where the other crew
members can say, "Boy, I really like to work on a crew with
that crew member, not because that crew member is more attractive
or more fun or more this, but is <em>functioning</em>. Someone
who knows procedure, <em>likes</em> procedure, and can function
in a way that we really feel like a mechanism that is working."
And then talk about satisfying! That becomes very, very satisfying.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I wondered if we might want to go onto the question
about getting your house in order, like regarding your possessions?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Oh, I don't think we can go to that one too soon. That's
a big one. Mention those things.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Getting house in order, possessions.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Getting house in order, possessions.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Indebtedness.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Indebtedness.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Credit card use.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Credit cards, boy, getting house in order, possessions, indebtedness,
credit card usage. Okay, we'll start. I don't think we're going
to get very far, but we'll start. If you stop and think about
it, the way the world out there is designed, it makes fools of
us, because we involve ourselves in activity that we have no right
to involve ourselves in. Now, how does it do that? Because we
involve ourselves in activity on the basis of what we have <em>borrowed</em>.
We buy now, pay later. We don't really buy now. We just sign
a paper, agreeing to buy. We haven't bought until it's paid for.
And according to our Heavenly Father's Kingdom, we shouldn't
be participating in things that are not available to us. If we
needed them, they would be available to us without signing a note
to someone or without having to possess something before we could
afford it. And yet the whole world out there revolves around
working with objects and things that we have not yet paid for.
That is backwards, and it also is obviously <em>not</em> of our
Father's Kingdom, because it binds you more to the human kingdom.
It puts you in a circumstance where if you left it to do what
we're talking about, you'd leave a mess. And we can't do that.
You can't leave a mess. So, we have to get our houses in order.
The first thing on his list, was get our houses in order, and
getting our houses in order means we've got to examine the whole
status of, <em>is there any validity to even possessing a credit
card?</em> Are we not then using something, using gasoline, paid
for with our gasoline credit card, that isn't ours that we're
going to pay for later? We can't do that. 
<p>
Well, as we sit here, there goes that 10-second marker and that
means that this session is coming to an end, and we have to pick
this one up in our next session.
