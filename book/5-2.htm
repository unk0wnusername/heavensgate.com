<h2><em><strong><center>"UFO CULT" RESURFACES WITH FINAL
OFFER</center></strong></em></h2> <center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="85%"> <h4><tr><td><em>The following
statements could sound very presumptuous.  However, these facts <strong>do</strong> come
into focus or "prove" themselves if they are seriously explored a step at
a time.  They could also sound very "doomsdayish." Though, in truth, they
will be the most joyous "sound of music" to the ears and eyes of those who
have been waiting for them.</em></td></tr> </h4></table></center>

<ul><li>The Earth's <a name="lnk2"></a>present "civilization" is about to
be recycled <strong>-</strong> "spaded under." Its inhabitants are
refusing to evolve.  The "weeds" have taken over the garden and disturbed
its usefulness beyond repair.

<li> The human kingdom was created as a <em>stepping stone</em> between
the animal kingdom and the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God (the Evolutionary
Kingdom Level Above Human).

<li> It is the soul that progresses from one kingdom level to another
<strong>-</strong> each kingdom level has its own unique physical
containers (bodies) for the souls that reside in that kingdom level.

<li> As the human goes out to find servants within the animal kingdom,
from beasts of burden to seeing-eye dogs <strong>-</strong> if that
animal grows to find pleasure only in serving its master, no longer
identifies as an animal, but sees itself as a family member in that human
family, and its behavior is pleasing to that human <strong>-</strong> the
two become <em>bound </em>together.  The human family then provides the
body (a human infant) for that soul to enter, allowing it to move up into
the human evolutionary kingdom.  (This is not to suggest that all human
infants are containers for souls moving up from the animal kingdom, for
most human infants are containers for human kingdom returnees still bound
to that family unit.)

<li>Likewise, when a member of the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God receives
instruction to incarnate among humans in order to seek out the souls that
might want to "separate from the pack" and are desirous of becoming only
servants in the Evolutionary Level Above Human, He then offers them the
knowledge and behavior that can open that door to them.  If that human
changes to the degree that he no longer desires any human behavior and he
pleases that member of the Kingdom Level Above Human, a <em>bond </em>is
formed and a body belonging to that new Kingdom is provided for that soul
to move up into.

<li> Both Kingdom Levels are physical and biological.  However, the human
kingdom is made up of mammalian <strong>-</strong> "seed-bearing"
<strong>-</strong> plants or containers, while the Kingdom of God is made
up of non-mammalian, non-seed-bearing "containers" for souls, and their
young or "children" are those who have risen above <strong>-</strong>
overcome <strong>-</strong> all human-mammalian characteristics and
behavior through the tutorship (midwifing) of a member of the Kingdom of
God who has been through that transition and bonded to His Father at a
previous time.

<li>Just as an animal sees his human tutor as the <em>one and only</em>
"master," likewise a human, as he becomes aware of a Member of the Kingdom
Level Above Human, sees Him as the <em>one and only</em> "God." However,
the individual that that human related to as God sees Himself as a "child"
in that higher, many-membered Kingdom and knows that only through His
"Father" (an Older Member in that Kingdom) can He become a better member
in that Kingdom.

<li>A "student" or prospective "child" of a member of the <em>true</em>
Kingdom of God can, with the help of an Older Member, overcome or rise out
of <em>all </em>human mammalian behavior <strong>-</strong> sexuality and
gender consciousness <strong>-</strong> and all other addictions and ties
of the human kingdom.  He must complete this change to the point of
abhorring human behavior before his soul can become a "match" with a
biological body of the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God <strong>-</strong>
for that new body is genderless and incapable of functioning at a human
level.

<li>The <em>true</em> Kingdom of God, the "Headquarters" of all that is,
is a many-membered Kingdom which physically exists in the
<em>highest</em>, most <em>distant </em>Heaven <strong>-</strong> a
<em>non-temporal</em> place (<em>outside of time</em>, and with
<em>eternal</em> life).  It is the only place from which souls, life, and
all <strong><em>creating</em></strong> originates.  Being non-temporal, it
<em>was</em>, <em>is</em>, and <em>forever will be</em> <strong>-</strong> a concept that
we, as temporal creatures, are not designed to comprehend.  That Kingdom
designed the "temporal" world outside its "borders" and designed its
temporal creatures to have a progression of bodies or "vehicles" (through
kingdom levels, such as animal and human) for souls to evolve through.  If
the soul survives and moves forward through all its tests along the way
<strong>-</strong> it can, with the help of a member of the <em>true</em>
Kingdom of God, lose its temporal characteristics and become a part of
their non-perishable, non-corruptible world.  However, <em>all other
souls</em> who reach a certain degree of corruption (having of their own
free will chosen to become totally separate from their Creator) will
engage a "self-destruct" mechanism at the Age's end, manifested when
opposing camps, be they human or "Luciferian," come together and destroy
each other <strong>-</strong> thus assisting in the plowing under of the
"garden" <em>for </em>the Creator.

<li>The reason the term "TRUE" Kingdom of God is used repeatedly is
because there are <em>many </em>space alien races that through the
centuries of this civilization (and in civilizations prior) have
represented themselves to humans as "Gods." We refer to them collectively
as "Luciferians," for their ancestors fell away from the keeping of the
<em>true</em> Kingdom of God many thousands of years ago.  They are not
genderless <strong>-</strong> they still need to reproduce.  <a name="lnk1"></a>They are
nothing more than technically advanced humans who have retained some of
what they learned while in the early training of members of the
<em>true</em> Kingdom of God, e.g., limited space-time travel, telepathic
communication, advanced travel hardware (spacecrafts, etc.), increased
longevity, advanced genetic engineering, and such things as suspended
holograms (as used in some religious "miracles").

<li>These "Luciferian" space races are the humans' GREATEST ENEMY.  They
hold humans in unknown slavery only to fulfill their own needs.  They
cannot "create," though they develop races and biological containers
through genetic manipulation and hybridization.  <a name="lnk3"></a>They even try to "make
deals" with human governments to permit them (the Luciferians) to engage
in biological experimentation (through abductions) in exchange for
technically advanced modes of travel <strong>-</strong> though they
seldom follow through, for they don't want the humans of this civilization
to grow to be another element of competition.  They war
among themselves over the spoils of this planet and use religion and
increased sexual behavior to keep humans "drugged" and ignorant (in
darkness) while thinking they are in God's keeping.  These Luciferians see
to it, through the "social norm" (the largest Luciferian "cult" there is)
that man continues to <strong>not </strong>avail himself of the
possibility of advancing <em>beyond </em>human.  Many things have become
the accepted "norm," but that doesn't make them right!

<li>Just as the biological body is the "container" for the soul, the soul
is the "container" for <em>Mind</em> (Spirit).  <em>Mind </em>translates
into the brain as <em>information </em>(knowledge).  Information is
available to humans from only two sources <strong>-</strong> the <em>mind
</em>of the Luciferians <strong>-</strong> or the <em>Mind </em>of the
Kingdom of God.  The  <em>mind </em>of the Luciferians yields
misinformation (promoting the behavior and concepts of this world).  The
<em>Mind </em>from the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God yields
<strong><em>true </em></strong>information (though the Luciferians and
their servants would reverse this interpretation).  As we
<strong><em>change</em></strong>, in the progression of overcoming
humanness <strong>-</strong> the percentages change <strong>-</strong>
of which <em>mind </em>occupies our soul <strong>-</strong> Truth
<em>increases </em>as misinformation <em>decreases</em>.  If we revert
back to humanness, the process reverses <strong>-</strong> the Truth is
aborted as the soul becomes more filled with mammalian <em>mind</em>.
That Truth can even be taken from us if we abuse it.  When our "eye
becomes single" or our soul is filled only with <em>Mind </em>or Spirit
from the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God, it becomes pure or <em>Holy Mind
</em>(Spirit).

<li>The <em>true </em>Kingdom of God's design permits the presence of a
"Luciferian" element, during a human civilization, as a catalyst for
growth.  Without it, we would have no choices <strong>-</strong> our
<strong>free will</strong> could not be exercised.  Our <em>right
</em>choices find us in alignment to recognize the Truth when it is
offered. <p> <hr width="50%"/><p>
<li>Two thousand years ago, the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God appointed an
Older Member to send His "Son," along with some of their beginning
students, to incarnate on this garden.  While on Earth as an "away team"
with their "Captain," they were to work on their overcoming of humanness
and tell the civilization they were visiting how the <em>true </em>Kingdom
of God can be entered.  The humans under the control of the Luciferians
killed the "Captain" and his crew, because of the "blasphemous" position
they held, and quickly turned the teachings of the "Captain"
<strong>-</strong> the Older Member's "Son" <strong>-</strong> into
watered down <em>Country Club</em> religion <strong>-</strong> obscuring
the remnants of the Truth.

<li>That same "away team" incarnated again in the 1970's in the mature
(adult) bodies that had been picked and prepped for this current mission.
This time the "Admiral" (the Older Member, or Father, incarnate in a
female vehicle) came with the Son <strong>-</strong> "Captain"
<strong>-</strong> and his crew.  As the two Older Members put out a
"statement" and held public meetings over about a 9-month period in
1975-76 to bring their crew together, the media tagged them the "UFO cult"
because of their expectation of leaving aboard a spacecraft (UFO) at the
completion of their "overcoming." The two Older Members then went into
seclusion with their crew (students), "lifting them out" of the world for
almost 17 years (not accepting any new students), making Earth's surface
their classroom.  This isolation was absolutely necessary.  The <em>degree
</em>of their <em>overcoming </em>of sexuality, addictions, and ties to
the human environment had to be taken to the point of <em>matching
</em>the behavior and consciousness of the Evolutionary Kingdom Above
Human.  Only then would their <em>new </em>"Next Level" bodies be
<em>functional</em>.  They resurfaced briefly for about a 3½-month
period in 1992, allowing some of their "dropouts" to rejoin them.

<li><strong><em>This changeover</em></strong> (sufficient "overcoming" to
inherit Next Level bodies) <strong><em>has been completed</em></strong>,
and before they return, they are instructed to share this statement with
you.

<li>The Luciferians are about to be "recycled" (annihilated) at the same
time as this human civilization is "spaded." They know that "rumor has it"
that their days are numbered.  They refuse to believe it and are desperate
to recruit souls from the human kingdom into their "Heavenly Kingdom."
There are many "counterfeit" heavens, and each "heaven" is at this time
collecting "names in their book," forcing a stand of allegiance,
polarizing each individual's commitment to his chosen "God."

<li>When members of the Level Above Human are physically present, the
opposing forces work the hardest against them in order to support their
own position.  They do almost anything to keep humans from following the
path toward the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God.  They "turn up the heat" at
this time in the area of mammalian behavior, primarily sexuality.  This
has become such an overwhelming presence in the Earth's atmosphere that
even some of the crew that came with us were lost to its temptation.
Don't forget that when the Luciferians were expelled, in order to support
their own desires, they had to condemn the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God
and see it simply as another path <strong>-</strong> inhumane and
radically uncompromising.

<li>The religious "cults" who have <strong><em>separated from the
world</em></strong> have "picked up on" one major aspect of what is "in
the air" at this time when the information of how to move from one kingdom
level to another is available.  What they may have failed to recognize is
that experienced "clinicians" are necessary to take souls through that
"weaning" <strong>-</strong> that difficult "withdrawal" from human
addictions and binding "misinformation" concepts.  If it weren't
<em>necessary</em> to have clinicians present who have <em>previously been
taken through</em> that transition, we wouldn't need to be here.  Some
religious "cults" might have children, participate in physical or mental
abuse, hold members against their will, have weapons, or break laws in
general <strong>-</strong> while we have long been aware that that type
of behavior is inappropriate, especially for a transitional "classroom."

<li>When the present "away team" leaves (which will be very soon), the
Truth will go with them.  You cannot <em>preserve</em> the Truth in your
religions.  It is with you only as long as a <em>Truth bearer</em> is with
you.  Only those from the <em>Land of Truth</em> can bear it.  It can only
be your future if you "reach out and grab it" while it is offered.  The
Truth can be retained only as one is physically connected with the Next
Level, through an Older Member, and that relationship requires that
non-mammalian thinking and behavior be sustained.

<li> Humans were, from the beginning, given a "prime directive" NOT TO
KILL OTHER HUMANS.  "In defense" or for "rightness" are no exceptions.
Righteousness is what most frequently causes conflict. "I'm right, you're
wrong." "You're causing me trouble, I'll wipe you out" (in the best
interest of all, of course).  The world's systems continue to make laws
permitting the breakage of higher laws <strong>-</strong> God's laws.
Weapons designed for killing humans are inexcusable.  There are numerous
methods of controlling a violent person without the necessity of murder.
The <em>irony </em>is, each killer sends its victims to <em>exactly
</em>where they want to go (to their chosen heaven).  Humans
<em>fight</em> for their <em>desires</em> <strong>-</strong> what they
choose to <em>not overcome</em> <strong>-</strong> what they cling to.
Our <em>desires</em> and <em>attachments</em> (or lack of them)
<strong><em>determine</em></strong> which heaven we're going to.

<li>A soul cannot end its own existence.  Though it may incarnate many
times and the body or vehicle it is wearing may be terminated, only the
<em>true</em> Kingdom of God <strong>-</strong> the Evolutionary Level
Above <strong>-</strong> Human can terminate the soul.  This termination
of the soul is the only proper application of the term <em>DEATH</em>.

<li>When a soul "awakens" in a particular "season" or incarnation (usually
sometime between college age and mid-life), it is <em>picking up</em>
where it <em>left off</em> at the end of its previous incarnation.  What
an individual participates in prior to that "awakening" is of no real
significance.  If a soul had previously overcome such human
characteristics as family ties and relationships, at his "awakening" he is
seen by those around him as suddenly becoming unstable, for he is
compelled to once again separate from those imposing ties and seek to
connect with what he had previously sought or connected with.  What he
primarily <em>learns</em> is what <em>is <strong>not</strong></em> for him
as he seeks for the Highest <em>Truth</em> or <em>Reality</em>.

<li>The media seems <em>devoted </em>to "saving" the public from radical
ideologies or "cults," particularly of seeming "religious" types.  Also a
news "scoop" requires haste.  These two elements together predetermine
that they search for any and all negative quotes that will discredit the
groups' leaders and the groups' behavior.  The fact still remains that
negative reporting far outsells positive reporting <strong>-</strong> and
after all, positive reporting of radical material can end or ruin a
reporter's career.  Well, it won't be hard to discredit this group from
its leaders down, for prior to and during their "awakening" and subsequent
coming together, they all made many mistakes and learned from them.  Plus
<strong>-</strong> you don't give up the ways of the world without the
condemnation of those who still advocate what you have overcome.

<li>When we came before (2000 years ago) the world "cleansed" or "saved"
<em>their </em>world from our "blasphemy" and merely got us our boarding
passes back to the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God on the <em>true
</em>"Enterprise" (spaceship or "cloud of light").  If you seek to cleanse
the world of our "blasphemy" this time, you would simply be the instrument
of <em>our</em> "days being shortened" while destroying <em>your
</em>"last chance" in this civilization to <em>advance</em>.

<li>Now at the close of an Age <strong>-</strong> every significant soul
of this civilization has returned (and is in or attached to a physical
body) to reap their reward.  Most who <em>think </em>they are <em>for</em>
the Kingdom of God are in fact working for the opposing side
<strong>-</strong> the counterfeit "Gods" <strong>-</strong> and will
want to condemn us.  Your actions, even your thoughts of condemnation
toward us, out of allegiance to your "God," will cause <em>our </em>part
of the Heavens to look upon <em>your</em> "god" with the same rejection.
<p><hr width="50%"/><p>
<li>Many say they live only for the "Harvest Time" <strong>-</strong> the
"Last Days" <strong>-</strong> the "Second Coming." Those are all finally
here! <strong>-</strong> Will you accept <em>us as them</em>?  You cannot
<em>bypass </em>us even in your prayers <strong>-</strong> you cannot
<em>insult </em>your Creator by refusing to go through the ones He has
sent to you.  There are souls here now for the express purpose of
connecting <strong>-</strong> and eventually bonding <strong>-</strong>
with the Next Level through us.  Those souls will be protected
<strong>-</strong> out of harm's way <strong>-</strong> and "saved" from
the approaching sorting out, recycling, and "spading under" of the
Luciferians and their human servants.  If you can get your name in our
"book," on our spacecraft's computer (and only there), making your actions
reflect that desire <strong>-</strong> then you will go with us.

<p><hr width="50%"/><p>
<strong><em>SUMMARY:</em></strong> Our surfacing is in reality a test of
the public's "civility." Can a society that is still dealing with bigotry
and prejudices against races, religions, and sexual preference extend the
<em>right of existence</em> to some who see <em>humanity</em> as a
<em>stepping stone</em> toward the Kingdom of God, and desire to take that
step and briefly offer it to others? Or is Earth's present civilization
still as primitive as it was 2000 years ago? We'll see!</p></p></li></p></p></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></p></p></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
