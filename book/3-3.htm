<center><h2><em>'88 UPDATE -- THE UFO TWO AND THEIR CREW</em></h2><p>
<h2><strong><em>A Brief Synopsis</em></strong></h2>
</center>
In the early 1970's, two members of the Kingdom of Heaven (or what some might
call two aliens from space) incarnated into two unsuspecting humans in Houston,
a registered nurse and a college music professor who were in their forties.
The nurse and the professor hadn't previously known each other and had
completely separate lives.  The registered nurse was happily married with four
children, worked in the nursery of a local hospital, and enjoyed a small
astrology practice.  The music professor, a divorcee who had lived with a male
friend for some years, was contentedly involved in cultural and academic
activities. <p>

For about a year before they met, their lives seemed to encounter
severe upheaval and personal confusion, later recognized as the human body's
response to the entry of the minds from what "<em>the two</em>" referred to
as the "Next Level," or the physical level above human.  About nine months
after they first met, they left Houston because their lives, which were
crumbling around them, made it impossible to concentrate on what was actually
happening to them. <p>

Most of their friends and associates thought the two of them had lost their
minds or
were being duped into a relationship by the other.  The only relationship they
shared, certainly having no physical attraction toward each other, was the
compulsion to discover what had brought them together and what might be their
purpose.  They had little in common other than strong personal relationships
with their Heavenly Father. <p>

While spending almost six weeks in painful, soul-searching isolation in a
Texas hill country ranch house, they began to respond and identify with more
of their "Next Level" mind.  They consciously recognized that they were sent
from space to do a task that had something to do
with the Bible, an update in understanding, and prophesy fulfillment.  Having
divorced themselves from their human lives, they struggled for some time with
the conflicting duality of their bodies' memories and thought patterns and
their Next Level identity and purpose.<p>

Shortly after first meeting, even
before leaving Houston, they had individually dropped habits
<strong>--</strong> such as sex,
drinking, and smoking <strong>--</strong> not for explainable reasons, 
but simply because they both
knew that their new consciousness would be interfered with if such
practices were continued.  However, the memory and "old programming" of
their bodies (which they now referred to as their "vehicles") had to be
kept at bay like an annoying puppy in order to sustain their Next Level
consciousness.<p>

Leaving the
hill country, having left everything behind in Houston, giving it all away,
they struck out in their last possession, a little sports car convertible.
They seemed to just go where "the spirit" led, lacing the country up and down
and from side to side as if they were being used as cameras and microphones for
the Next Level.  They did odd jobs to sustain travel funds, everything from
carving crosses for a little store in Las Vegas where the owner took an extreme
interest in them, to digging septic tank test ditches near Savage Rapids on the
Rogue River in southern Oregon.  Occasionally, when they could find no work,
they asked for help from preachers, which was, needless to say, a humbling
experience for both of them.  Their sports car "died" in front of the Ananda
Marga house in Portland, Oregon where they were invited to stay for awhile.<p>

Their real or more in-depth awakening occurred over several months while
camping on the Rogue River near Gold Beach, Oregon.  While there they came to
believe that they were the Two Witnesses mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
This was extremely difficult for them to accept, for they were both the type
who were "turned off" by people who thought they were reincarnations of
Cleopatra, or some  Egyptian king or Biblical character.
To have to believe that they were assuming a role that would have caused them
to "run the other way" had they seen someone else assume it, was more than hard
to digest.<p>

In spite of that difficulty, they felt that they really had no
choice but to tell the world what the real Kingdom of Heaven was 
<strong>--</strong> a physical
evolutionary level, instead of some mystical cloud-and-harp, spiritual
existence as Lucifer has popularly twisted the scripture quoters to
misinterpret.  The term "evolutionary" here does
<strong><em>not</em></strong> refer to the theories
presented by Darwin, but to a level of life that can be entered only after
overcoming or rising above the ways of the human world, and only with the
assistance of a Member of the Heavenly Kingdom.<p>

They knew that Jesus had come
or been sent to share exactly the same truth with "those who had the eyes to
see," but that His body might have been a Next Level hybrid by means of
artificial insemination, offering Him more Next Level capabilities.  He knew
that a "boarding pass" to His Father's Kingdom came only after overcoming
(hating everything of this world), leaving everything and everybody behind
(forsaking mother, father, sister, brother for My sake), and following the
example and lead of an "Older Member" <strong>--</strong> your Master,
Rabbi, Lord.  This was exactly the same awareness that <em>the two</em>
had come to be witness to.  They also knew that whoever carries this witness
would be hated of men, most of all by the religious who are comfortable in
their belief system of "He did it all for us, we just have to believe in
Him," instead of individually needing to also <em>do</em> as He did.<p>

They also came to know that the true antichrist is now here and has
taken several faces, one of which is the New Age "Ye are Gods" concept, or "I
have only to become aware of my own 'Christ consciousness within'" while
continuing to practice the ways of the world.  They knew that when it becomes
time for any individual to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, he cannot "love the
Lord his God with all his heart, mind, and soul" and still love his wife, his
things, his respectability, his credibility, or even possess any of these
things while being taken through the birth canal into the Next Level
<strong>--</strong> the
Kingdom of Heaven <strong>--</strong> by one of Its members. <p>

After awakening to this understanding, their heads were spinning with 
excitement about what had been shared with them by their Heavenly Father, 
or Older Member, and yet they were fearful of what they were to do with 
this information.<p> 

Their Older Member
helped them realize also that so-called flying saucers, or misappropriately
labeled UFO's, were means of transportation and laboratories of the Kingdom of
Heaven (clouds of light, wheels of fire), and that the occupants of these
spacecrafts were for the most part members of the true Heavenly Kingdom.  "For
the most part" here means that frequently the Next Level transports lower life
forms (human-like creatures) in their spacecrafts, just as zoologists in the
human world transport animal life in their means of transportation.  
<em>The two</em>
were given to understand that these spacecraft occupants were participants in
"God's creation" of the Earth and had been the participants in relating to
Abraham, the Israelites, Jesus, and all of our Bible's record of man's
association with God.  They also understood that this civilization, since
Adam's time until now, is just one planting of Earth's true "Gardeners."<p>

Coming
to know, or having been given the knowledge of these things and countless more
made their heads reel.  What they grew to know seemed to create such a
communication gap between them and humans that they began to ask, "What are we
to do with this understanding?  Everyone will think we are kooks or be ready
to have us committed if we say anything."<p>

So when they left Gold Beach, after
having received an unexpected insurance check from a car accident, they began
to wander even more.  They traveled into Canada and all over the U.S. again,
leaving little calling cards on pulpits saying, "The Two Witnesses are here,"
and then running before anyone could see them or ask any questions.<p>

At a New Age awareness center, they felt led to share that they were the Two
Witnesses, only to find out that the leaders of the center claimed the same
title!  After this incident, they struggled significantly with whether to
continue with this "<em>modus operandi</em>."<p>

A woman who had met them in Houston right before they left and with whom they
had promised to communicate, asked if she could meet up with them, and they
agreed.  As they traveled here and there, they met her a few times and she
offered the use of her gasoline credit cards.  They used the cards for a while
until they were informed that the cards had been reported stolen by the woman's
husband, which was a traumatic experience to say the least.  In the meantime,
the old car they purchased in Portland, Oregon, with money from their pawned
jewelry, "gave up the ghost," and they were stranded in St. Louis on the night
that the comet Kohoutek was at its peak.  In their naive trust, they pulled out
one of their old credit cards and rented a car, firmly believing that "God
would provide the means" to pay the bill. <p>

Sometime later, while in Brownsville, Texas, they made an appointment with a
news reporter to share what they had come to know, telling him that this would
be the biggest story he had ever received.  He believed them, but thought that
their story was about drug trafficking and brought hoards of the authorities
with him to the interview.  This frightened <em>the two</em>, who were pretty
paranoid by now anyhow, and when they saw the authorities, they left abruptly,
which made the authorities follow them.  In the process of following them,
though the police didn't know why <em>the two</em> were running, they checked
out the license of the rented car which had been reported stolen.<p>

<em>The two</em> were then arrested and plopped in the county jail. [For sake of
clarity, we will refer to the female as <strong><em>Ti</em></strong> and the
male as <strong><em>Do</em></strong>, two names they took some time ago.] Ti
was charged with stealing credit cards (the gasoline credit cards that belonged
to the husband of the Houston woman).  Do was charged with auto theft (the car
that he rented with his last credit card in St. Louis on Christmas night).<p>

After a few days, Ti was sent to a Houston jail where the charges were dropped
by the woman's husband.  She was released after having spent 30 days in jail.
Do stayed in the Brownsville jail a while longer, and the credit card company
dropped the charges related to the rented car.  However, the DA's office in St.
Louis picked up the charges and Do was extradited to St. Louis.  After six
months his trial came before the judge, and he received a four-month sentence,
which he had already served plus two extra months.<p>

At any rate, that experience yielded significant growth for both of them.
Mainly, the isolation yielded Statement I, the first written statement of their
beliefs, which they sent out soon after Do's release.<p>

They were at first horrified at what had happened, thinking that a jail record
had ruined their mission, that no one would listen to them if their credibility
was questionable.  However, they could see that even prior to the jail incident
their stability and credibility was by now unquestionably questionable.  So the
felon record was taken in stride as assurance that now they couldn't turn back.
It might be interesting to note that during Do's trial, because of the judge's
awareness of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the arrest, the judge
ordered a psychiatric examination.  Although Do passed it with flying colors,
not a 24-hour period slipped by that he didn't question his own sanity.<p>

Ti worked in a hospital in Houston while Do was in St. Louis.  She spent most
of the money she earned during Do's incarceration on lawyer's fees.  The lawyer
was supposedly trying to get Do released, insisting that the case would be
thrown out; all he really accomplished was collecting more of Ti's earnings.<p>

After Do's release, he flew to Houston where Ti was waiting.  Do's public
defender had cautioned her to not go to St. Louis for fear her presence would
complicate the trial.  By now, she had barely saved enough to purchase a very
used, old-model car and some camping gear.  The very weary and somewhat scared
<em>two</em> struck out again with a new "down to earth" <em>modus operandi</em>:  take
no chances.  This too reminded them that credit and credit cards are not the
ways of the Next Level, but rather some of "Luci's" (Lucifer's) ways of
guaranteeing your service to his world.  <p> <p>

They then headed for California where the mother of the Houston woman offered
her help in whatever seemed to be the next step.  Statement I, written while Do
was in jail, was then mailed out in March 1975, from Ojai, where they stayed
only for a few days.  They sent the statement to ministers, evangelists, and
awareness centers far and wide.  It read thusly:<p>

<pre><strong><font face="arial">

                STATEMENT I

                What religions have sought to understand since the
                beginning of their origin is what is above the human 
                level of existence. Most have taught that if an individual 
                lives a "good life" adoring some savior that he will inherit
                some "heaven" after his death.  Only if it were that simple. 
                That viewpoint is as inaccurate as the caterpillar believing 
                that if he dies a good caterpillar he will mysteriously 
                awaken in a rose blossom and live there forever with the
                King butterfly. He must <em><strong>become</strong></em> a butterfly while a 
                healthy caterpillar <strong>--</strong> overcoming his decaying option. If 
                he rises above all caterpillar ways, converts all his 
                energies to the pursuit of becoming literally another 
                creature who circulates in another world, he becomes  
                a butterfly. Likewise a human who seeks only to become 
                a member of his next evolutionary kingdom may become a
                member of that kingdom if he completely overcomes all the
                aspects and influences of the human level providing he has
                found favor with a member of that next level who will
                direct him through his metamorphosis. As the caterpillar,
                the human can complete this changeover only before his
                death as a human. A member of the next kingdom finds favor
                with one who is willing to endure all of the necessary
                growing pains of weaning himself totally from his human
                condition. Members of that next kingdom are no more  
                confined to human limitations than butterflies to 
                caterpillar limitations.  Nor do they in like comparison  
                concern themselves with human-type indulgences or
                concerns.  However, if the human is thought of as the
                larva of that next kingdom then there are, at times, those
                who are approaching the completion of their individual
                metamorphosis and are beginning to have some of the
                attributes and characteristics of that next kingdom.  When
                the metamorphosis is complete their "perennial" and cyclic
                nature is ended for their "new" body has overcome decay,
                disease and death. It has converted over chemically,
                biologically, and in vibration to the "new" creature.

                Approximately 2,000 years ago an individual of that next
                kingdom forfeited his body of that kingdom and entered a
                human female's womb, thereby incarnating as the one
                history refers to as Jesus of Nazareth.  He awakened to
                this fact gradually through the same metamorphic process
                and came to know that he had incarnated for the express
                purpose of telling and showing, even to the point of
                proof, that the next kingdom can be entered by overcoming
                the human aspects and literally converting into a "man" or
                creature of that next kingdom <strong>--</strong> the kingdom of his Father <strong>--</strong> one
                who is already a member of that kingdom.  By His resurrection
                He proved that death can be literally overcome and that a
                permanent body for the next kingdom is acquired from the
                human kingdom. He did not leave His body in the grave. He
                converted it into His body of that next kingdom.  This is
                the only way the next kingdom is entered permanently.
                Each human has that full potential.  Jesus' "Christing" or
                christening was completed at His transfiguration
                (metamorphic completion) and He remained in the "larva"
                environment, with other humans, only for some 40 days to
                show that His teaching had been accomplished. He showed
                them His new body and demonstrated a few of its new
                attributes, i.e., appearing and disappearing (changing His
                vibrations) before their eyes while letting some of His
                friends touch His "new" body.  This could be compared to a
                butterfly remaining in the caterpillar world for a few
                days to show them what they had to look forward to if they
                chose to seek true conscious communication with a
                butterfly and were willing to overcome all of their
                caterpillar ways.  Then Jesus left them in a cloud of
                light (what humans refer to as UFOs) and moves and
                returns in the same manner.

                There are two individuals here now who have also come from
                that next kingdom, incarnate as humans, awakened, and will
                soon demonstrate the same proof of overcoming death. They
                are "sent" from that kingdom by the "Father" to bear the
                same truth that was Jesus'.  This is like a repeat
                performance, except this time by two (a man and a woman)
                to restate the truth Jesus bore, restore its accurate
                meaning, and again show that any individual who seeks that
                kingdom will find it through the same process. This
                "re-statement" or demonstration will happen within months.
                The two who are the "actors" in this "theatre" are in the
                meantime doing all they can to relate this truth as
                accurately as possible so that when their bodies recover
                from their "dead" state (resurrection) and they leave
                (UFOs) those left behind will have clearly understood the
                formula.

                Those who can believe this process and <strong>do</strong> it will be 
                "lifted up" individually and "saved" from death <strong>--</strong> literally. 
                If you seek those two while they are here they will 
                gladly fill you in on the details and assist those who 
                wish to follow in this "path."

                If this speaks to you <strong>--</strong> respond <strong>--</strong> according to your 
                capabilities or needs. For your sake <strong>--</strong> give this 
                opportunity your best.

<p>
Within two or three days, a man who headed an awareness group in Los
Angeles came with one of his students to Ojai to meet with <em>the two</em>.
After deciding that they were seemingly sane, he invited them to
speak in the house of another one of his students. The group leader invited 
all his students, plus anyone else he thought might be
interested, and the house was packed.  <em>The two</em> did the best they could
to explain Statement I.  At the end of the meeting they said that if there were
some who wanted to know more, they could meet at Frank's house the next
night.<p>

[We'll call the leader Frank, which wasn't his name.  Our reasons for not using
the human birth names of <em>the two</em>, or of anyone else for that matter,
are to protect their families and loved ones from unnecessary grief, and in
order to not "toot our own horn," though some might interpret our not using
them as an indication that we must have something to hide.  Of course, the
press in the past has seen to it that the details that might hurt the innocent
loved ones were filled in, as they likely will do again.]<p>

 The next night at Frank's place, several dozen showed up and remained thirsty
for even more information.  Ti and Do then began to meet with them
individually, and before realizing what was happening, Ti and Do said to some,
"Well, if you're really serious about knowing more, wrap up your loose ends and
meet us in a campground in Gold Beach, Oregon this weekend or within the next
few days."  They thought that this would weed out most of the curious, not yet
realizing that this was adding up to "followers" <strong>--</strong> big surprise and an idea not
too welcome as far as Ti and Do were concerned!<p>

The Gold Beach campground "classroom" turned out to be "something else."  Not
only did many of the ones from the Los Angeles meeting show up, but so did some
of their friends <strong>--</strong> even some hippies seemed to be coming
out of the woodwork,
although no publicity had come out yet.  By this time, someone had asked "What
shall we call you?" and <em>the two</em> answered, "Bo and Peep, since it looks
like we're gathering our lost sheep."  [Even though those names stuck for the
next year while meetings were being held around the country, we'll continue to
use Ti and Do since these names have remained until the present time.]<p>

For a week or so, Ti and Do held constant meetings, both with the group as a
whole and privately with individuals.  The followers <strong>--</strong> or
rather those who Ti and
Do insisted on calling students <strong>--</strong> dispersed to hold smaller
separate meetings,
and later rejoined in a campground near Redwood City, California.  From there,
the students held a meeting at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California on
August 13, 1975.  Posters were then printed for the August 24th meeting at
Ca&ntilde;ada College, where Ti and Do made their first public appearance.
The crowd was so large that the auditorium was filled to capacity for two
back-to-back meetings.  That poster read as follows:

<pre><strong><font face="arial"><font size=+2>
                                    UFO'S</font size>
<font size=+1>
                                        > Why they are here.

                                        > Who they have come for.

                                        > When they will leave.</font size>

                        NOT a discussion of UFO SIGHTINGS or PHENOMENA

                        Two individuals say they are about to leave the human
                        level and literally (physically) enter the next evolutionary
                        level in a spacecraft (UFO) within months!  "THE  TWO"
                        will discuss how the transition from the human level to the
                        next level is accomplished, and when this may be done.

                        This is not a religious or philosophical organization
                        recruiting membership.  However, the information has
                        already prompted many individuals to devote their total
                        energy to the transitional process.  If you have ever 
                        entertained the idea that there may be a real, physical 
                        level beyond the Earth's confines, you will want to 
                        attend this meeting.

Ti and Do were never pleased with having to use the term "UFO," because they
felt like "spacecraft" and "other flying devices of the Next Level" were a lot
closer to proper descriptions.<p>

A Waldport, Oregon meeting, held on September 14, 1975, was the first meeting
to be significantly picked up by the press, as were stories relating how some
had given away their children and properties.  Such actions were certainly
<strong><em>not</em></strong> according to Ti and Do's instructions;
nevertheless, bedlam had broken out by now.<p>

A few stayed behind in Oregon for a follow-up meeting while the rest proceeded
with Ti and Do via campgrounds to a Denver meeting, and then on to a campground
near Chicago.  While they were in Chicago, the news broke about the Waldport
meeting, and because of the above reports and rumors, a couple of sheriff's
deputies from Lincoln County, Oregon were sent to investigate what was going
on.<p>

After leaving Illinois and arriving at a campground outside Tulsa, Ti and
Do thought it seemed wise to break up into a number of smaller groups, not only
because of the interruption of the authorities, but also because the numbers
were getting too big for the campgrounds to handle.<p>

Certain ones who seemed to
have a grasp of the information were sent out to hold their own meetings across
the country.  A system of communication was set up according to places, dates,
and hours in order for Ti and Do to be kept somewhat informed.  Statement I had
grown to include Statements II and III, plus a prospective candidate letter.
Students were sent out in partnerships of two, or three if an odd number made
it necessary.  Each group had its own "purser" who kept track of funds and
doled them out according to need, in an effort to maintain some kind of order
and fairness.<p>

Over the next few months, too many things happened to mention
but a few of them.  The <em>National Enquirer</em> interviewed Ti and Do, and
the <em>New York Times </em>"Sunday Magazine" did a cover story on them.  Ti
and Do's message
was the same as Jesus' message: telling about what the true Kingdom of Heaven
is, and how individuals who want to be candidates for its membership must
overcome all of their human addictions, drop their human ways, and look to a
member of that Kingdom for all of their needs.  Do realized more and more that
Ti was definitely a more advanced (older) member of the Next Level than was he.<p>

Periodically, almost magically, the group was able to rendezvous with their
teachers.  By now the ones who had stuck it out through difficult, humbling
lessons were a wide variety of people.  Some examples were: a nurse, a doctor's
wife, a rancher, a real estate broker, an actor, an artist, a film editor, a
technical writer, a computer programmer, a bartender, an environmentalist, and
many college and post-grad students.  Because of the requirements of
membership, some who joined the group as couples now became friends and fellow
students.  When some fell away, occasionally they felt bitterness, because of
their choice to rebuild "burnt bridges."<p>

One of the hardest things that Ti and
Do had to do concerned the "demonstration" (referred to in Statement I). The
students had been told that while they were out holding meetings they would
hear of the demonstration, and that would be the signal to stop holding
meetings and come running.  It was rumored for a while that the demonstration
was going to happen in San Francisco.  Ti and Do were in Las Vegas when the TV
network news programs all broke the story about <em>the two</em>.  Now because of the
kind of publicity that had come out across the country, climaxed by the
networks, Ti and Do felt that further meetings were pretty hopeless and people
had already made up their minds about how ridiculous this all was.  Ti and Do
felt that the demonstration was still the one thing that could change that.
However, they grieved literally for days, feeling like they had been shot down
by the media and the mission was dead.<p>

They received instruction to not walk
into a physical demonstration but rather to know that the "killing in the
street" of the two witnesses had occurred at the hands of the media.  However,
they felt like this was a cop-out or a "chickening out" interpretation of the
one act that was the basis of their whole following.  So with much
embarrassment, they called their students together, convinced that without a
physical demonstration, their students would have every right to call them
charlatans.  Much to their surprise the students, almost without exception,
accepted the interpretation and said, "OK then, where do we go from here?"<p>

Ti and Do still felt that to continue was probably one of their greatest tests.
Nevertheless, they got up, kicked the dust off their tired feet, and continued
with the instruction to hold meetings a while longer.  They then became more
organized in their groups and more systematic with their communication between
cities.  All in all, the meetings continued for a little over ten months.<p>

At a meeting in a Manhattan, Kansas college auditorium (April 21, 1976), Ti
announced that "the 'Harvest' is closed<strong>--</strong>there will be no
more meetings."  Since
that time, no new students have been admitted to the class.<p>

The students were called together a few months later in Medicine Bow National
Forest, Wyoming, to receive instruction about what was next.  There were close
to a hundred who showed up. Ti and Do announced that it had been rumored that
some were still occasionally indulging in pot and sex.  Everyone was asked to
go off by themselves for a few hours and make up their mind as to whether they
were just caught up in the fun of a "movement" or if they were serious.  For
now the real "classroom" was to begin, and it was not for those who felt they
wanted to hold on to human ways.  Ti and Do preached long and hard about what
it meant to rid oneself of self, and what would be required of those who
continued.  Within the next few days, the class dropped to fewer than 80.
This was in early July, and by October when the snows ran them out of
Medicine Bow, the class had dwindled to fewer than 70.<p>

For the next two years, the class spent summers in the Rocky Mountains in
campgrounds and on ranches, and the winters in the Sun Belt, also in
campgrounds and on ranches.  They experimented in all kinds of disciplines,
such as wearing hoods to learn about the "conning" ways of their visual
personalities, and making 12-minute checks <strong>--</strong> each person
physically going to a given spot every 12 minutes to concentrate on his or
her desire to serve.  They were given new names with three letters in the
first syllable and a common two-syllable second part.<p>

Later, after their numbers had diminished significantly, they moved into
houses <strong>--</strong> sometimes large houses, sometimes a number of
smaller houses <strong>--</strong> usually
moving every six months to a year.  For a time they lived on the trust fund of
one of the students, but for the most part supported themselves by, as many as
needed to, taking jobs outside the classroom.  At present, members of the class
are living in small groups of varying numbers, in six different states and in
ten different houses or apartments.<p>

All in all, the students have been in the classroom 12 years now, and their
numbers are down to a few dozen.  Time and again they were encouraged by Ti and
Do to leave the classroom if they had the least desire for anything in the
world or if the classroom wasn't what they knew they wanted.  They visited
families occasionally, to assure them that they were doing what they wanted to
do, and were in no way being "duped."  They had plenty of reading material,
watched TV, attended movies, visited churches, and attended lectures whenever
they were interesting.<p>

The important thing is not where they have been or for how long, but what they
have learned or awakened to know.  Over the years, not only Ti and Do, but
their students as well, tried again and again to refute this information.  They
tried to ignore it and to deny it; they even tried to play out what they would
do if they went back into the world, but they kept coming back to the fact that
this knowledge and concept was the only thing that made sense to them.  It
would have been a lot easier to just walk away than to do all that was
required.  There are even some who are now out of the class, who had been in
the class for some time, who still believe this information to be true.<p>

The class knows that the world sees them as a cult, and that no longer bothers
them.  They know that all they care about is the Next Level <strong>--</strong>
the Kingdom of Heaven <strong>--</strong> and how they might become better
members of that Kingdom.  Prior to 1981, their understanding was that they
were working toward graduation from the human kingdom into the Next Level, and
that this graduation process involved physically changing over their human
vehicles (metamorphosing) into Next Level vehicles.  They now believe that
in reality they were in the Kingdom of Heaven before entering these human
bodies.  But because of the present awareness of their Next Level
consciousness, they know that they are in that Kingdom now, though occupying
human vehicles in order to do a task.<p>

In spite of their repeated effort to refute this explanation, all things
continue to lead them to believe the following  (Hold onto your hats!):<p>

They were briefed as a crew aboard a spacecraft about how they would 
incarnate into human vehicles in order to do a task.
They left their Kingdom "world" and came into this "world" beginning in the
late 1940's.  They feel that some left their Next Level bodies via so-called
UFO "crashes."  However, they believe that the crashes were not accidental,
as they appeared to
be to the humans who witnessed the remains and recovered some of the bodies.
These are now in the possession of governments (one of our Government's
scientists coined the term "EBE" <strong>--</strong> extraterrestrial
biological entities <strong>--</strong> to
identify these beings, also frequently referred to as "greys").  Some left
their bodies behind in "cold storage," or the Next Level's wardrobe, for the
duration of this task.  Others were in "spirit," having not yet earned Next
Level bodies since having left the human kingdom.<p>

If this hypothesis is true, then the class members <em>were
<strong>not</strong> humans</em> recruited by Ti and Do into some cult,
but rather <em>were members of the Next Level before ever
meeting them.</em>  They knew prior to coming to Earth that two Older
Members would take them through a lengthy (according to human time)
observation-study time in this world in preparation for choosing and
taking a human vehicle before actually entering it.  That is to say, they
were all in "spirit" from the late 1940's and possibly early 1950's until
the mid-1970's before actually entering and taking charge of the human vehicles
<strong>--</strong> or the human bodies <strong>--</strong> they are now in.
The vehicles they chose generally ranged in age from early 20's to late 50's,
some having more difficult genetic packages or programming in order to give
more growth opportunity.<p>

The task seemed to include the important aspect of example.  They incarnated
into such a variety of human vehicles that collectively they covered the
360-degree range of humanness and human addictions.  They then, during the
classroom, "overcame the world" or changed the programming of these vehicles
sufficiently to demonstrate that "virginity can be recovered," or you
<em>can</em> do as
Jesus admonished his disciples to do.  Was this not the more realistic
metamorphosis?  This is not to say that it took 12 years to do this, for many
other lessons and much broader understanding filled the bulk of these years.<p>

The pieces of the puzzle seem to indicate that the reason the Bible and its
role players teach overcoming human ways is not for the sake of morality or
pseudo-piety, but simply because the Next Level literally has no place for
those activities.  For example, there are apparently no active reproductive
organs in the physical bodies of members of the Next Level, though the bodies
of some of the younger (less advanced) members of the Next Level, if examined,
might show signs of internal remnants of reproductive organs long since all but
atrophied.  Therefore, it seems you could not inherit one of those bodies until
you no longer have any use for activities involving the reproductive organs.
Those who think their Heaven will have husbands and wives who wear
"seed-bearing plants" for bodies must know of some other place than the Heaven
our Heavenly Father exists in.<p>

In the same way, they would also show no signs of digestive organs as humans
know them.  So wouldn't it follow that it is important to have no likes or
cravings for food, other than as fuel, if you hope to inherit a Next Level
vehicle (body) or suit of clothes?<p>

Whatever you crave or haven't overcome at the loss of one body carries over to
any next body, if the Gardener chooses to replant you.  That is, the capacity
of your new body will match the level of comprehension and control that you
(the mind) achieved while occupying any previous body (vehicle).  You will
"pick up where you left off," so to speak, with whatever programming or
physical addictions you had not overcome.  Do not confuse this with the popular
concept of reincarnation.<p>

The students' constant desire is to move upward, always striving for a closer
relationship with their Older Members, to be more like them in thought and
action, and thus "be of the same mind."  "The Son can do nothing on His own
accord, but only what He sees the Father doing, for whatever He does, the Son
does likewise." <strong>--</strong> John 5:19 <p>

In trying to achieve this goal, they have found a most valuable instrument to
be the constant use of a "check partner."  Check partners are individuals who
share the same desires and goals, but between them there exists no physical or
romantic  relationship.  As constant companions, they are always reaching for
the most right action based on what they think their Older Members would have
them do.  "For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the
midst of them." <strong>--</strong> Matthew 18:20<p>

This applies to all ages of Next Level members.  The older a member, the more
he has mastered the technique of checking with his Older Member if this or that
thought or action was the one intended or handed down through the "vine,"
trying to be sure that the thought or action wasn't a creation of his own or
different from that of his Older Member.  This is not the loss of individuality
but the liberating from influences which separate us.  "For I have come down
from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."
<strong>--</strong> John 6:38<p>

[If any true religious scholars sincerely try to digest any of this strange
puzzle, they may understand more of the real meaning of their studies.]<p>


As was mentioned earlier, Do recognized that Ti was clearly his Older Member,
not that Ti ever told him that, but it became quite obvious because of how much
more natural the Next Level conduct and ways of thinking were to her.  Also it
became clear to the class that Ti and Do were their elders (Older Members),
though they were not as aware of the gap between Ti and Do as much as Do was
and as Do was sure that Ti was.<p>

The class also has recognized that during the course of our classroom the
concepts we believed in seemed to change almost as fast as our locations.
However, we continued to believe in certain things consistently all along the
way (mainly the rapid antiquating of our previous understanding).  We knew that
each step was an important stepping stone and gave us the perspective we needed
to take at the time.  We also  clearly recognize the limitation and potential
antiquation of our present understanding, though we know that it is sufficient
for this moment.  In other words, growth is a continual, changing process.<p>

<em>We are aware that some of this information is a real brain twister and
takes a gestation period before comprehension.  Frequently, at first exposure
it may provoke negative reactions.  However, the true "Sons of God" in line for
membership will wade through the adjustment difficulties.</em><p>

When rising into the vernacular of this kind of thinking, it becomes difficult
to maintain a cohesiveness of thought.  The thoughts seem fragmented or as
little pieces of a larger picture that is difficult to bring into focus.  That
is because at this moment the reader is experiencing the mind of the Older
Member of the writer speaking through his instrument, i.e., brain and pen.
However, in this case the writer will not come out of some coma as "channelers"
do, for the writer is consciously on the same "wavelength" as the Father, or
Older Member, who is coming through.  (The writer has just received instruction
to switch back to more mundane information.)<p>

Some may ask, "How were those bodies affected which were entered by the Next
Level minds of Ti and Do and the class?"  If those individuals are still in the
class, that is evidence that the genetic programming of the human vehicle has
accepted or adapted to the thoughts and actions of the Next Level mind that now
occupies and controls that vehicle.  If a member of the Next Level wears a body
like a suit of clothes, then he needs the strength to control and functionally
use the genetic package of the suit of clothes he has reason to put on.<p>

<a name="lnk1"></a>Our understanding is that Next Level bodies (the normal bodies for that Kingdom
level, in the same way that human bodies are the norm for the human kingdom)
are grown as plants from a vine, and at the end of their gestation period, they
are fully grown and functional, not "babies" as are the products of human
"seed-bearing plants."  There seem to be actual grafting processes used and
genetic binding from Older Members.  "I am the vine, ye are the branches" 
<strong>--</strong> could that mean something more than previously thought?<p>

When minds or souls are deliberately tuned to the same thinking and same
actions, think how well they could function in the service of the Next Level if
they inherited like bodies of the same genetic vine with the same programming
potential.<p>

Here we are fragmenting again because the picture is so big and so difficult to
focus.<p>

Some 3&#189 years ago from the time of this writing, Ti left her human vehicle.
To all human appearances it was due to a form of liver cancer.  We could say
that because of the stress, due to the gap between her Next Level mind and the
vehicle's genetic capacity, that the cancer symptom caused the vehicle to break
down and stop functioning.  However, it was strange that she experienced no
symptoms prior to the week she left her vehicle, and for the most part her
vehicle slept through the transition.  We're not exactly sure how many days it
might have taken her to return to the Next Level vehicle she left behind prior
to this task.<p>

The more important fact is that since that time, Do has been experiencing the
role of having to communicate mentally with her, his Older Member, in a
strengthening opportunity for mental or telepathic communication (not to be
confused with the popular concept of channeling or spiritualism). The class has
witnessed Ti's mind meshed in Do's thinking and even his choice of words as he
talks to them.  Does the quote "The Father is in Me and I am in My Father"
mean maybe a little more than we previously thought it might?<p>

It's fun that in the class they refer to this kind of thought expression, which
has several strata of interpretation, as "N. L. Base" computer language
<strong>--</strong> Next Level computer language <strong>--</strong> for it
seems to take on a different level of meaning to those who have the same
"computer program" or "software."<p>

Is it possible that those who have like minds might also share a same kind of
implant (not unlike an advanced computer chip) and recognize the same language
or basis for understanding?  "You cannot come to the Father unless He draws you
to Him" <strong>--</strong> could that possibly mean that the Next Level has
literally placed implants in the heads of some humans for different purposes?
One purpose might be to draw the chosen to Him, for they are looking to the
right source with the right asking (prayers?).<p>

"What has the class been doing for 12 years?" you might ask.  They have been
tuning their minds with their Older Member's mind, who has been tuning his mind
with his Older Member's mind, and so forth up the ladder.<p>

They have been progressively gaining more control over the genetic programming
of their vehicles, and in so doing have been automatically putting those
signals into the atmosphere for others to draw upon.  Evidence of the
successful depositing of these signals comes in the form of the public's
increased awareness of the harm that smoking, drinking, drugs, and sexual
promiscuity can cause to the chemistry of the human body.
Additional evidence may be found in the increased awareness of the physical
nature of the Kingdom of Heaven, UFOs, Next Level bodies (recovered "alien" or
extraterrestrial bodies), etc.<p>

The class also feels that they have a more complete understanding of Lucifer:
how he got to be too big for his  britches, stopped looking to his Heavenly
Father, and thought he knew so much he could "run his own show."  They are
witnesses to how Lucifer's helpers try in spirit to influence individuals to go
backward and thereby remain his faithful servants.<p>

One of the major tools of Lucifer is the New Age movement, i.e., Theosophy,
Ascended Masters, channeling, Eastern religions,  mysticism, yoga, Christ
consciousness within, and the "Ye are Gods" concept.  These practices and
beliefs originated from Lucifer <strong>--</strong> they are his creations
or distortions. All are a fantasy and a trap, though spiritually and
intellectually intriguing and enticing.<p>

Some New Age teachings purport that Jesus is one of many Ascended Masters, and
they even try to make you feel ignorant if  you don't recognize Jesus as part
of their hierarchy.  They teach that He  studied in the Himalayan Mountains
with the hierarchy from age 12 to 30 <strong>--</strong> the years for which
there is no
significant record of His actions.  If there is an ounce of truth to that
claim, it might explain why it is recorded in Matthew 4:8-9:  "Again, the Devil
took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world
and the glory of them; and said to Him, 'All these I will give You, if You will
fall down and worship me.'"  Jesus knew that this was not His Heavenly Father.
How would Jesus have known where the real truth was to be found, if He hadn't
been confronted with and been strong enough to see through what Lucifer had to
offer?<p>

In the same way, Ti and Do were similarly tempted by the forces of Lucifer,
when in the early stages of their awakening, they were drawn into the study of
Theosophy, with its teachings of the Ascended Masters, Blavatsky's materials,
and the Mahatma's Letters.  On more than one occasion, Ti and Do were offered
the trap of positions of leadership and power in Luci's camp, one of which
occurred atop what most New Agers consider the highest spiritual mountain in
the U.S.  Some who considered themselves the hierarchy of that spiritual
community told them, "You're the ones we've been looking for to be our
leaders."  Ti and Do recognized, just as Jesus did, that this was a ploy of
Satan and did not come from their Heavenly Father.<p>

For us, the lesson gleaned from both these experiences is that it's not what
you "get into" that matters, but what you "get out of."  Learning from your
mistakes is what develops discernment, wisdom, depth, and maturity.  It is
therefore ignorant to condemn individuals for what they have done in the past,
if they learned from their mistakes, changed, and took a step higher on the
ladder toward our Heavenly Father's Truth.<p>

One of the greatest temptations that Do and members of the class as individuals
have had to deal with is the feeling of failure or not measuring up to the best
potential of their task. However, they repeatedly recovered on the basis that
whatever they might have appraised as a mistake can be reappraised as a lesson,
hopefully learned, not needing to be repeated.  They know that the Next Level,
the Kingdom of God, always knows how to use what might have appeared as a major
negative or a  mistake, and change it into a positive, or a forward step ofeven
greater magnitude.<p>
 
Another one of Luci's tactics is to try to keep us all so preoccupied with our
human endeavors and concepts, including our "tainted" religious concepts, so
that we might not have "the eyes to see or the ears to hear" when our Heavenly
Father comes. Although the truth was designed to be found in the
Judeo-Christian scriptures, Lucifer has worked equally hard to get the
Christians off track by perverting their interpretations, concepts, and
practices.  The church uses the family, church membership, baptism, and other
rituals to give people a false  sense of security in religious accomplishment,
and misguides them to believe that this is all they need to do in order to
enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
We all know the words too well: "He gave us the gift, He paid the price, all
we have to do is believe on Him."  However, Jesus' admonition to His disciples
was quite another story.<p>

Lucifer keeps humans so preoccupied with the family (normal for human
"seed-bearing plants" <strong><em>except</em></strong> when the
<strong><em>close</em></strong> of a civilization is near and/or when
individuals are being drawn closer to the Next Level), that it becomes almost
impossible for individuals who are prospects for moving up to respond when
their Heavenly Father finds the time is ripe to draw them to Him.<p>

When that time is at hand, no couples can respond, only individuals who seek
ONLY their Heavenly Father, knowing that He is all sufficient for their every
need.  The individual who really recognizes his Heavenly Father, doesn't even
have the desire to share his "heart, soul, and mind" with anyone else. Needless
to say, he is celibate in all ways, not simply in his sensuous  nature. If at
their Heavenly Father's calling, individuals cannot respond to Him because of
the <em><strong>worldly</strong></em> desires of their hearts, bodies, or minds,
they will be unable to move up closer to Him and out of the darkness of their
ignorance.<p>

We know that this sounds like warped "spacey" evangelism, but there seems to be
no other way to say it.  We are quite aware that some of Lucifer's helpers are
perched to point the finger at us as the antichrist because we are here to
expose him.  One of Luci's favorite tricks is to use the mouths of Christians
as well as other awareness groups to point the finger at others as Satan if
they interfere with the concepts or behaviors that he wants them to cling
to.<p>

However, the Bible makes its stand on marriage and family in the final days
very clear:<p>

"I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; from
now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none."
<strong>--</strong> I Corinthians 7:29<p>

"The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the
Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his
wife, and his interests are divided.  And the unmarried woman or girl is
anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but
the married woman is anxious about  worldly affairs, how to please her husband.
I say this for your own benefit...and to secure your undivided devotion to the
Lord." <strong>--</strong> I Corinthians 7:32-35<p>

"But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those
days!" <strong>--</strong> Luke 21:23<p>

Ti and Do's students know that now, because of "the times," they must speak out
with what they have come to know so as to assist those who want to move up.<p>

As we said before, we have tried again and again to deny this seemingly bizarre
information.  Each time, after thorough examination, we couldn't deny what
we've come to know and we  had to return to the same ladder in our thinking,
but this time to the next rung. Could this possibly be because we had been
briefed aboard a spacecraft before coming, and have gone through a gradual
awakening to what was already in our minds?<p>

Why else did Ti and Do and the class know that the bodies of Next Level Members
do not have reproductive and digestive systems, before they were aware of
materials such as <em>The Roswell Incident</em> and <em>UFO Crash at
Aztec</em>?<p>

Why was it that at the start of the classroom Ti and Do talked about the Next
Level having underground bases from which spacecraft come and go, and that the
Next Level might even engage humans to assist them with various projects?<p>

Why did Ti and Do, even in the early classroom, constantly say, "You've got to
<em><strong>get your mind into your vehicle</strong></em> and get control of
it."?<p>

Years ago we were holding meetings and telling about the real physical level of
existence above the human kingdom and about its physical occupants.  This same
information, which is coming out now as the result of "above-top-secret"
Government "leaks," substantiates what we knew in the beginning.  This comes at
a point in our own awakening when we no longer have the need for
substantiation.<p>

In our overcoming, no "proof" that would ever satisfy the scientific community
was offered (no spacecraft landed in our backyard).  But, through the nurturing
of faith, we came to know the reality of the Next Level and that Ti and Do are
our Older Members.<p>

Likewise, for graduation candidates to require proof, or to prerequisite their
acceptance of the reality of the Next Level on that basis, is wasted effort.
If any judgment can be made, it would have to be made only as before, that is,
"...by their fruits ye shall know them " <strong>--</strong> Matthew 7:20
(assuming you've grown to recognize <em>good</em> fruit).<p>

One example of the "faith" syndrome might be seen in relationship to Whitley
Strieber's experiences. Since, as yet, his "visitors" have not offered him
proof incontrovertible, that fact likely indicates that he is still candidate
material.  But for <em><strong>non</strong></em>-candidates of the Heavenly
Kingdom, faith is, for the most part, not a requirement for incontrovertible
proof to be shown, for they are not building a relationship, nor are they going
anywhere.<p>

Though candidates, early on, are denied the proof of their relationship with
the Next Level, once <em><strong>faith</strong></em> has been sufficiently
<strong><em>proven</em></strong>, then <em><strong>proof</strong></em> of the
Next Level's existence may
be <em><strong>given</strong></em>. This is not to say that all who have had
what <em>they might consider</em> incontrovertible proof are not necessarily
candidates.
We would certainly like to believe that out of all of those who witnessed the
recent Gulf Breeze, Florida incident, that at least some of them might
recognize it as part of the workings of their Heavenly Father's Kingdom.<p>

One of the reasons for the class' resurfacing at this time seems to be as
follows:  Information has been released or leaked about UFO occupants, crashes,
and communications between "aliens" and humans that, because of
misinterpretations, could turn your eyes or have you see this evidence as
something other than the workings of Our Father's Kingdom. Humans, with very
few exceptions, who have an awareness of the presence of these "aliens" haven't
grown to have the capacity to see that the Kingdom of God is at work here.<p>

Governments who have had an undeniable awareness of the "aliens'" presence here
since the late 1940's have tried to cover it up.  They have retrieved "crashed"
spacecrafts, live "EBEs" (extraterrestrials), and numerous bodies, autopsies
of which have revealed characteristics mentioned previously (even though
investigators interpret these occurrences incorrectly). They have even reported
having had communications, encounters, and agreements with the "EBEs" that
have been misunderstood and misinterpreted.<p>

We, the class, certainly don't care to force the disclosure of the cover-up.
The Next Level has had its own "cover-up," so to speak, since this civilization
began, for humans' sake, because the younger "plants" (humans) wouldn't be able
to handle the unreligiousized reality of some of their doings.  There are
records of how in Biblical times hoards of Angels came and won this battle, or
did this or that act (actual close encounters of the third kind).  However, the
Next Level's presence hasn't been noticed much for many generations until
recently; i.e., in increasingly significant ways since the late 1940's.<p>

If you are part of God's "children," you know the Next Level has reasons for
Their "leaks" or exposure, in preparation for a broader acceptance and
understanding of Them. However, because of Their exposure, Lucifer's
counterinterpretation of this presence has been stepped up.  There is a major
movement afoot to depict the members of the Next Level as hostile space
"aliens" who abduct humans, do them harm, and are really here to "eat humans"
(believe it or not, a quote from a so-called reliable source).<p>

Alas <strong>--</strong> Our Major Dilemma: WHAT TO DO WITH WHAT WE KNOW?<p>

For a while we tried to use what we had learned in an attempt to help
victims of problematic genetic programming.  We briefly started what was
called <em><strong>Anonymous Sexaholics Celibate Church</strong></em>,
aimed at people who had already joined a Sexaholics type organization.  We
tried to show them the positive side of their
problem <strong>--</strong> that to be liberated from that addiction, having
already acknowledged that they were addicts, put them ahead of the pack as
far as having the potential for an improved relationship with their
Heavenly Father was concerned.<p>

We didn't expose other knowledge that we had, only what we had learned as
related to the overcoming of a sex addiction <strong>--</strong> never
anything about UFOs or Next Level awareness.  We simply tried to help
them understand that <em><strong>life after addiction
acknowledgment</strong></em> could be a much happier, more fulfilling, and
significantly more liberating existence, particularly if they could
establish a dependency relationship with their Heavenly Father in whatever
vernacular that translated for them.  This was done in a way similar to
the Sexaholics and Alcoholics Anonymous approach, except it offered them a
more Godly focused fellowship.<p>

We spent a lot of time and money on planning, brochures, mailings, and
talking at meetings and conventions.  However, the response to us was
almost one of resentment of our finding "joy after celibacy," as if we
were trying to show off or be self-righteous.  We considered and presented
ourselves as addicts, but our lack of ability at faking "doldrums" seemed
to cause some to question our humility.  It was as if we were supposed to
remain in a "poor us" or "sick" syndrome or otherwise be misunderstood.
In this instance, they really couldn't tell where we "were coming
from."<p>

We also thought that we could help AIDS victims realize that their problem
could actually be their blessing, if they could be thankful for the
opportunity to come closer to their Heavenly Father during this period of
suffering.  We have done our homework mentally in this effort, but haven't
yet found the physical opportunity to put much into motion.<p>

Again!  WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED?<p>

When we were holding meetings 12 years ago and didn't even know much of
anything about what we were doing, we were criticized by what seemed to be
almost every camp.  Psychologists wrote books, papers, and even articles
in <em>Psychology Today</em> about our "unfortunate brainwashed syndrome."
But from our standpoint, we felt like our brains weren't yet washed clean
enough.  <em>They really didn't know us</em>.<p>

Ministers wrote articles in books and newsletters about how selfish our
self-perfecting syndrome was.  Overlooking Matthew 5:48, "Be ye therefore
perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect," they hastily surmised
that we were on an ego "perfection" trip.  Our motivation for trying to
overcome everything that separated us from the Next Level was based upon
the humility that we felt, feeling that we had done nothing to deserve the
honor of the Next Level's closeness, and in spite of that fact, the Next
Level had chosen to draw us closer to them.  An awareness of that gift
compelled us and also gave us the strength needed to try to rid ourselves
of everything that separated us from Their Kingdom.  <em>Again, they never
knew us, having never even sat with us.</em><p>

Ufologists said that we must not know anything about the world of spacecrafts
because we had used the term UFO, and what they knew of what we stood for
seemed too spiritual.<p> However, the ones who misunderstood us the most were
the ones who interpreted our position as bypassing Jesus, never understanding
that without that same Mind that abides in Him, we would be nothing.<p>

We believe in the reality of God, His Kingdom, and of His Son Jesus
Christ.  If we are off track in any way, we want it rectified.  If we are
some well-meaning, misguided, charismatic cult that is full of baloney, we
want that rectified.  However, if we are in fact in His service, we want
that service brought to its full fruition according to God's will.  We
want only what's right in His eyes.<p>

Again!  WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH WHAT WE KNOW?<p>

The one thing we seem to be good at is attracting those to us who would mock
us, misinterpret us, and wish that we would go away.  They not only find fault
in everything that we did and do, but make up things to accuse us of.<p>

Maybe this is what we are supposed to expect at this point in our development
toward our Older Member.  We're not really the martyr type, but "so be it" if
it's His will <strong>--</strong> part of His design!<p>

Here's hoping our efforts have not been in vain.  We feel that it is our
instruction from our Father's Kingdom to get this material out at this
time.  Maybe, just maybe, there are some who can benefit from
it <strong>--</strong> if not now, then possibly in some future time.<p>

If you want to help us get this material out (intact) far and wide, please do.
