Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 5
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr/>

Well, this is the fifth session in our series. I'm not going
to bother naming the series again, because if you don't know what
the name of it is now after four sessions, we're all in trouble.
So, we might refer to it as our <em>overcoming</em> series.
<p>
I have asked the students who helped with Sessions 1 and 2 to
return to the scene and assist me in our questions today. So,
let's get going. Before we get into it, I must let you know that
this fifth session is a major step beyond the previous sessions
we have had. When we get more into the particulars of overcoming,
then we need to somehow narrow our audience more to the serious
seekers - I don't like to sound spiritual in that - but
to the ones who feel that somehow or other this is connecting
with them. And I'm hoping that those who are viewing this session
are in that position in your heads so that we might have something
to offer you instead of something to amuse you or to give you
to find fault with.
<p>
For starters, I'm recalling two or three things that we discussed
in our last session that I would like to clarify a little bit
more. One is when we discussed separating from the family (the
<em>vehicle's</em> family) as you associate with the family of the
<em>soul</em> or you become a part of this transition from human
kingdom to the Kingdom of Heaven. And if you remember, I said
the family can take the attitude - when a serious student
begins to relate to them less - they can take the positive
attitude and say, "Well, I'll just have to put them in My
Heavenly Father's hands because I know that what they really want
is to please Him, and I'll have to trust that He'll take care
of them and that He'll not let them go astray."
<p>
Now I want to go a step further with that and say that the ideal
would be if we could touch or connect to a degree with a family
member, so that the family member could somehow have some respect
for what we're doing, even though I know that because of what
the world has become it's almost impossible to see, particularly
in our Anglo-Saxon world. In parts of the world where Buddhism
and Hinduism and a lot of eastern religions are so prevalent,
a family feels honored to have a child enter one of their communities.
In this country, it's ok only if it's an established church,
and I say that again,<em> only if it's an established church</em>.
Usually, even then, the established church has to be one that
that particular vehicle's family related to. For example, in
a family of Catholics, if one of their members desires to become
a priest or nun, or even become cloistered (when they really separate),
you may or you may not hear from them for some time. Even though
they miss hearing from that member of the family, they understand
it because it has become acceptable, it's become admirable, it's
become something that they feel good about because one of their
children has desired to become holy, so to speak, or trying to
get very close to the Kingdom of Heaven. But if a member of your
family in this world, or in the average family in this world,
steps out of society and goes off with someone that no one has
ever heard about and that someone is not representing a church
that is an established denomination, then they have gone off with
a "cult." That's the way it comes across. That's the
way the media accepts it. That's the way the neighborhood, the
society, the church accepts it. And then they begin to pray for
that person because they have been duped and they have gone off
with a cult.
<p>
I can assure you that Jesus wasn't hung on a cross - nailed
to a cross - because He made everybody in the neighborhood
happy. He was hung on the cross because they <em>hated</em> Him.
Not just because He said, "I am the King of the Jews,"
or "I am from the Kingdom of Heaven." Those were, of
course, blasphemous enough. But the thing that we forget
- the thing that was most upsetting to the family units or the people
at large - was that He had, in a sense, come in and said what
He had to say. And He formed a group, a little nucleus of believers,
and they had picked up, and they'd left everything behind, and
they were following Him. They might have made contact a few times
in the same way that members of our class have. You've heard
me speak of our classroom. Our classroom, don't forget, has been
working for over 16 years in secret separation from the world,
so to speak. And our class has made a point to get in touch with
members of their family as we got instruction to do that, and
they try to do it in the gentlest way and the way that would cause
the least problem for them. Frequently we got instruction for
them to go and visit their families. So, over the years they
have visited their families a number of times. They have written
them letters, they've talked to them on the telephone a number
of times, but I'm sure it's never enough. I'm sure it isn't satisfactory.
And I'm sure that many times when the family sees them it's almost
more uncomfortable than it would be if they hadn't seen them,
even though they would be very upset had they not heard from them
or seen them.
<p>
But what I started to say was it would be more ideal, certainly
from the classroom's point of view, if the family member said,
"I don't know what you are doing. You can understand that
your father and I are upset, since we don't know what you are
doing, and it's hard for us to know how to find a niche in our
computer to put your activity. We don't know where to put your
teachers. We see them as somebody who's kidnapped you, so to
speak, from our life. You've dropped out of the world, you're
in another world and you're not a part of our family." If
they could say, "Well, even though I don't know what you're
doing, you're an adult and I have to give you that. I have to
respect that, and I'll be happy when I can hear from you."
I guess what I'm trying to say is, if a family has a decent attitude
- or at least a respectful attitude, a permissive attitude
- toward a class member, then it's a lot easier to be in touch with
that family member, and it's even easier to be more frequently
in touch with that family member because they don't make demands.
They like to hear from you, but they don't say, "Are you
going to come home next month"? or "Will I see you in
2 months"? or "You gotta come on home because Uncle
so-and-so and Aunt Susie haven't seen you and we're going to have
a family reunion." If they start making demands, then unfortunately
the class members start retreating - and here you are going
to say, "Why? Why do the class members then have to start
retreating"? I have to address this question because you
could say, "Does that mean that Ti and Do and this little
cult have very rigid rules and nobody can leave their confines
without permission"?
<p>
I remember once early in the days of our classroom, when one
of the members of the classroom was having a difficult time with
doubt, and during the time of doubt had almost wanted to leave
the classroom.  But having gotten past it, came and said to Ti 
and Do, "Don't <em>ever</em>
let me be so foolish as to walk out this door. <em>Please</em>
don't let me be so foolish as to walk out this door. Keep me
here 'til I come back to my senses." Well, I'm afraid Ti
and I tried that for a short period. We tried to encourage that
individual not to go. We did everything we could to let that
individual stay until their senses returned. And what happened,
of course, is that bitterness increased. We began to see the
handwriting on the wall, and we said, "This isn't working.
The individual is not recovering. The individual doesn't want
to be here, so let's quickly let that individual be where that
individual wants to be."
<p>
From that time forward we learned from <em>that</em> lesson. And
we said <em>frequently</em> to every member of the class, "If
you have any doubt about being here, please express it. Let's
see what money we can muster and what plane ticket or train fare
or whatever it will take to get you where you want to go. And
if we can give you a little bit to help you in that transition,
we'll try." I can remember times even when it seemed that
doubt was lingering with a few and we said, "Listen, we've
got a little bit of funds in our reserve and the class is now
offering any member of the class two thousand dollars if they
would like to leave the classroom" - almost as if to
try to make it tempting to them to leave, if they could be tempted
to leave the classroom. The point I'm making is that we repeatedly
and repeatedly said, "If this is not where you want to be,
it is not our responsibility to help keep you here until you get
past a period of doubt." We learned from that lesson. So
lest you be deceived, you could ask any member of our classroom
and they could set you straight on where we stood as far as our
desire to have a student be exactly where they want to be at any
given moment. I mean, if a student wakes up in the middle of
the night and they say to whichever group they happen to be with,
"I'm just so full of doubt I don't want to be here...just something
seems wrong." Sometimes our classroom is broken into several
pieces and several cities, but there's always someone assigned
as "overseer" or "procedure helper" or some
similar task, that they could go to. And we always have a setup
where that individual is encouraged to do what they want to do.
We don't feel badly about them. We <em>certainly</em> don't get
mad at them. We just feel sad for them, but we want them to be
happy. We want them to have what they want. We want them to
find what they are looking for. If this is not what they are
looking for, they should not be here <em>one moment</em> past not
wanting to be here.
<p>
Now, I told you some time ago that when we started with our little
classroom - when we called the ones back after holding meetings
- we called them into a campground on top of the mountain in Wyoming.
There were about a hundred members in the campground, and we
said, "At this point, we're going to get serious. I mean,
we've got to stop doing this and this and this, and there's no
room for sensuality, for indulgences, and this and that, it just
doesn't work<strong>;</strong> it doesn't fit in with overcoming." And I
told you that, wow! within a very short time, our numbers were
in half. And here we are 16 years later, and we've come from
a hundred down to...a couple of dozen? And yet to me and to Ti,
and I don't say this to try to just build up or elevate, because
I'm not in that business - the members of this classroom,
that couple of dozen individuals, they're <em>significant</em>.
They're <em>beautiful</em>. They are attempting with all of their
might to be nothing but vessels of the Kingdom of Heaven. They
don't want any separateness. They don't want thoughts of their
own. They want to fill that soul - that pillowcase we've
talked about - only with the mind that comes from the Kingdom
of Heaven and to quickly stay and remain and improve in the business
of <em>aborting</em> everything that comes from any other source.
<p>
So, before we get into the particulars of overcoming, I did want
to go over that aspect of separation from the family with you
again and try to help you understand it. Because, if you're still
watching our sessions, you're beginning to suspect that around
the corner might possibly be some action for you that would cause
you to be in a very precarious position. And I'm afraid that's
true. So, now we're going to try to help you understand that
position and how to deal with it a little better.
<p>
What did we have on our questions here to address next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> We were going to catch up with, "What about the
Holy Spirit of the Trinity"?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Oh, that's right. Okay. In a previous session, I began to
try to explain to you how any member of the Kingdom of Heaven,
whether in the Kingdom of Heaven or even having left the physical
aspect of the Kingdom of Heaven to return to the human kingdom
for a task for the Heavenly Kingdom, is a trinity within themselves.
They are a Father to Sons. They are a Son to a Father or Fathers.
But we never got to the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost aspect
of the Trinity. You've probably figured out that the way that
parallel, or illustration of the Trinity - Father, Son, Holy
Spirit - applies, is in the percentages in that soul/pillowcase
of what kind or quality of mind is in the majority of that "mind
substance." That is, how much mind is of our Father's Kingdom
- <em>Pure mind,</em> <em>Holy Mind</em>. It doesn't mean that it's
100%. It means that the percentage is so great that the minority
seldom rules. The majority rules. The majority controls. The
majority I'm referring to is <strong>that portion of that mind that
occupies that space in that soul</strong>. So, in that sense we have
a Father to Sons (or younger members, or someone pursuing or making
a transition from the human kingdom into the Kingdom of Heaven).
We have a Son who has a Father or also a Grandfather, and calls
them "Father," "Father in Heaven," or calls
them "Teacher," or calls them by name if they have a
personal relationship with one who is in that position to relate
to them. And then also that individual - if their mind has
over 50 percent - when it takes a vote on any issue, the good
rules. Even though sometimes the minority really shouts loud
trying to get a voice, they have learned to have the <em>majority</em>
rule. Therefore, that <em>spirit</em> or that <em>mind</em> that
is occupying that space in that soul, is <em>Holy</em> Spirit, is
<em>Pure</em> Spirit, and is in control.
<p>
Okay, what's next on our little list of things we haven't gotten
to?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I thought from the previous session you wanted
to clarify the design of the human kingdom, and I think you'd
said that it wasn't designed to work.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Right, thank you for bringing that up. I believe what I
mentioned was that I said the human kingdom isn't even <em>designed</em>
to work. The Creator didn't design it to work. And I feel that
I need to correct that a little bit. If you'll back up, you'll
remember that we said the Creator even had a design of possibilities
within the word processor - within the program - that any human could
take as options in their path of existence.
That even all the options to go astray existed. But can't you imagine
our Father also knew that all the options to go astray ultimately would
not be satisfactory, hoping that by not finding them satisfactory
that that in itself would be an element to help someone who is
going astray arrive at a condition of saying, "This isn't
working. I've been trying this, I've been pursuing this."
<p>
Since the world as a whole here at the end of this Age, this
particular Age, has primarily gone astray, then we can accurately
say that the design does not work. Because the design that is
in motion - the design that exists - is one that was not
designed to work, because it is counterproductive as far as getting
into our Father's Kingdom. But, in that sense, the fact that
it doesn't work is such a super thing. Because if someone can
come to their senses for a moment, they could have a moment of
sobriety. Remember how we've talked about the big problem is
that we're drunk with the influences of this world and with the
things that act as a drug to keep us from having any common sense
and of being able to tune into the reality or the Truth of our
Father's Kingdom?
<p>
But you know one thing, according to the historical record, it's
difficult for a wealthy person to get into the Kingdom of Heaven
- almost as difficult as it is for a camel to get through an eye
of a needle. We don't know what that illustration really meant.
Some say that it meant a rope that was made out of camel's hair
(it's hard to put a rope into the eye of a needle), or it may
have actually meant a camel getting through. There was a little
gate in the side of the temple that was referred to as the "Eye
of the Needle," and it was so low that a camel had to be
down on its knees and dragged through. So, we don't know which
illustration was the correct illustration or the appropriate one.
But one thing that a wealthy person has that many other people
don't have, is that a wealthy person many times has the money
to try about everything. And if they really tried about everything,
they begin to, or they <em>could</em> begin to see, "You know,
this isn't working<strong>;</strong> this isn't getting me anywhere. I thought
that I would be happy when I had these possessions, when I could
travel wherever I wanted to without any limitations<strong>;</strong> my closet
could be as full as I wanted it to be<strong>;</strong> I could have ten closets
instead of one<strong>;</strong> I could have a chauffeur<strong>;</strong> I could have a maid<strong>;</strong>
I could have this<strong>;</strong> I could have anything taken care of. I could
get the best education I could get. And boy, could I be friends
with the people in power, because I have something that they want.
And I could even have a voice in those things." Now, those
are all things that are tempting in a way, but also a person with
that much facility in a world that revolves around money, as far
as power is concerned, that person could have experienced so many
things that they could say, "I thought that somewhere I would
find some satisfaction, and I'm not finding it."
<p>
Usually at that point Lucifer jumps in and says to them, "Well,
then your satisfaction can be found in being a humanitarian with
this wealth that I have bestowed upon you." Now Lucifer
moves in as if he is their goodness, their God - as if he
has bestowed this upon them. And he says, "In order to keep
you from being too dissatisfied and pursuing a truth in another
direction, I'm going to say, 'I can give you more satisfaction,
if you're beginning to get dissatisfied, by now using your time,
your energy, your talents, in humanitarian efforts, in charitable
organizations.'" Don't misunderstand me. Humanitarian efforts
are about as good as it gets in the human kingdom. Helping others
is about as good as we can get in the human kingdom - trying
to give our energy to others. But if we are still into what it
does for <em>us</em>, to be the benefactor, then it's not really
doing <em>us</em> any good, even though it might help the ones that
are the recipient. Funny thing is, though, the way the Kingdom
of Heaven is designed, there's not one individual out there who
needs help that doesn't get it. Wow! On the spot - if it's
help that can help them. If someone asks the Kingdom of Heaven
for help, and it is not the kind of help that would help them,
sometimes they get it, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they'll
get it in order to give them a chance to learn that what they
asked for won't really help them. Or, they could<em> not</em> learn
from that lesson and continue to pursue it. But if they go back
to the Kingdom again and say, "Well, now what's next for
me? What is the more right thing for me to do"? Then they'll
get the lesson of, "What you asked for before, even though
I gave it to you, it doesn't really <em>help</em>. It's not that
long lasting in what it has to offer." The point I'm trying
to make is that the human kingdom, because of what it has become,
you can take advantage of the fact that it doesn't work <em>if</em>
you're pursuing our Father's Kingdom. And this will come up again
and again and again. Just as the world will turn <em>against</em>
you if you start to separate, the fact that the world turns against
you <em>assists</em> you in separating, because that is the way
it is <em>designed</em> by the Creator.
<p>
Okay, where are we? What's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, since the overcoming process has to happen with
the personal guidance of a member of the Next Kingdom, what happens
between visits?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> That's a good question. You know, what got Jesus in trouble
the most was when He said, "My Father sent me here for your
sakes. I can redeem you to Him. If you believe He sent me and
if you believe what I say, if you believe the teachings that I
give you, and you do those teachings, and you continue to approach
Him through <em>me</em>, I'll get you there. Or, He'll get you
there through me, because He has appointed me to that task."
It's like He has assigned a <em>midwife</em> or He has assigned
a <em>nursemaid,</em> a tutor - someone to help you through that.
That seems to be the pattern, certainly in <em>this</em> Age. 
He certainly did that in Jesus' time, and that's certainly what
caused Jesus to find Himself on the cross.
<p>
I've got to skip to another topic here, because there's something
I keep wanting to bring up, and it slips out of my head and it
comes back and I'm talking about something else. So, I'm going
to just slip out and talk about it. I heard a pretty prominent
television minister not long ago say if Jesus did not resurrect,
literally, physically, actually <em>resurrect</em> from an honest-to-goodness
<em>dead</em> state from in the tomb, after having been on the cross,
if that <em>miracle</em> of resurrection from the dead did not occur,
then <em>everything</em> in Christianity is a farce. That appalls
me. I can't identify with that kind of thinking at all. That's
certainly not of our Father's Kingdom. I mean, as far as I'm
concerned, Jesus was no less who He was, His Truth was no less
what it was, His Heavenly Father was no less than Who He is, even
if Jesus merely staged that event to try to help them symbolically
understand that if you followed the Truth, death is overcome 
- you aren't dying. I'm not saying that's what happened. Fortunately,
I don't know. But what I do know is, it doesn't make a hill of
beans which the case was. 
You're on the wrong track if you're staking your relationship with
the Truth that came from our Father's Kingdom
on the basis of, "If He didn't die on the cross - I mean
<em>dead</em>, so that any present-day doctor would have said, 'He
is dead, dead, dead!' And then He came back to life and rose
and here He was...if that didn't happen, then all that was a lie"?
I say you don't know what He was all about. You don't know the
Truth that He had to offer. You don't know His purpose in being
here. Because that illustration had relatively very little significance
to His purpose here. His purpose was, as He told His disciples,
"Go teach about the Truth, give out the good news about the
Kingdom of Heaven. It's at hand!" In other words, "You
can get to the Kingdom of Heaven if you follow me."
<p>
Now, we've been talking about - the Last Days - meaning
the last days of this Age. There's another way of looking at
this, and that is that these can be your last days even if they
aren't the last days of this Age. What is your concern? Do you
want this to be your "last days" in the human kingdom?
Or are we, out of fear of it being the end of the Age, motivated
to try to clean up our act and overcome the world? Wrong motivation.
I mean, we can take advantage of it, maybe. If it's a negative,
if we do fear it, it can help us. But that's not the point. 
The point is if the Kingdom of Heaven <em>visits</em> you in any
form, or sends a Representative and gives you a gift of the opportunity
- a gift of <em>life</em>, a gift of eternal life - if you but
<em>do it</em> (follow that shepherd). From where we sit, why would
anybody not do it? I almost feel like if I were in your condition,
I would think, even if it wasn't true, why wouldn't I do it? 
Why wouldn't I try it? Because what is so valuable to me if I
know that life is so short here, and certainly if I've come into
a realization that there are more possibilities than one little
"bleep" as far as the human's existence in the human
kingdom. Then why wouldn't I want to try overcoming the world
if that's a possible way to get to the Kingdom of Heaven.
<p>
But that's irrelevant, because there's no position of argument.
I can't talk you into this. I don't <em>want</em> to talk you
into this. I have been assigned a task of delivering this information
to you, offering this information to you, <em>offering</em> it <em>only</em>.
I'm not to threaten you. I'm not to tell you that you are cast
into the sea of fire if you don't do it. What is important is
if this turns on a light in your head, and you say, "I must
have connected with this information before at some previous time,"
or if you don't even say that and you say, "I know this is
right."
<p>
Remember how we talked about when a person awakens they're "jiving"
with where they were at a previous incarnation? We said, of course,
if they haven't done much overcoming of the world in a previous
incarnation, then their awakening is not going to be evident.
And the more they have overcome in a previous incarnation, the
more traumatic their awakening would be, because their awakening
would thrust them out of the world if they had done a lot of overcoming.
Where were we? Who's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> You were talking about the times when the personal guidance
isn't here, like between visits. I don't know if you want to
get back into that anymore.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> No, I <em>do</em> want to get back into it some more. When
the Kingdom of Heaven has someone present to offer that to you,
then you have to be braced for what is ahead for you. And we
have saved this to begin to talk about it in this Session 5, because
it gets a little sticky. I mean, we've talked about only one
aspect of it that is a little sticky, and that is the aspect of
what happens in the relationship with the flesh body's family
as we separate from that family, and how difficult that adjustment
is. You know, when Jesus was here - we just talked about
it a moment ago - those who followed Him, because of how their
neighborhood, their structure, their families, the world around
them was so upset by the fact that they did follow Him, and some
of the Truth that He said was so blasphemous, that it found Him
being crucified. Then after He left, those disciples were true
to His teaching to the best of their ability...and the Truth was
not very diluted for the remainder of their existence here.
<p>
If you know your history books, you know that most of the disciples,
if not all of them, were martyred. There's some debate as to
John<strong>;</strong> maybe John is an exception - the one who supposedly wrote
the Book of Revelation. Now, I'm not saying prepare yourself
for martyrdom. But I am, in a sense, saying prepare yourself
for a difficult, difficult task if you come this way, if you choose
to come the way of overcoming.
<p>
We've talked about how this information that is available to
you is like a door that is open for a brief time and then that
door has to close. Back in '75 the door was open for the classroom
for about a 9-month period. In other words, there were meetings
held and there was talk to the public for about a 9-month period.
And that was in 1975! And from that time until now it's been
silent...silent. Here it is again with these sessions that that
door is opening for a brief period of time. Why a brief period
of time? That's what I'm trying to explain, when I explained
to you what happened to Jesus and what happened to His disciples.
As soon as Jesus left, and certainly by the time His disciples
left, in order to survive, the churches that continued to try
to teach Jesus' teachings, could not carry them out. They had
to compromise them in order to survive. Because the world out
there would have responded too negatively to people continuing
to break from their human "plants," separate, become
grafts onto a Heavenly vine, and not exist in the world.
<p>
Therefore, I'm saying to you that the time that we will offer
this information is short. We're not going to continue to hold
these sessions for some time. We'll see where this goes, but
I would suspect that we might have 6 or 8 or 10 or maybe a dozen
sessions at the most. And where it will go from there or what
shape it will take, I have not received any instruction yet. 
But I do know that the door has to be briefly open, and that you
must respond to it in that brief period of time. Beyond that
you won't be able to find us, unless the world somehow or other
forces us into a circumstance that would be easier for you to
find us. For instance, the media might tell you we're in such-and-such
a jail, or we're confined in such-and-such a "nut house."
<p>
I want you to be sure, in case you wondered, that no group of
individuals on the face of the Earth tries harder to live in accordance
with not breaking any rules of the world - not doing anything
that the legal world could find fault with us, whether it's the
IRS, or any of the legal aspects of the world.
<p>
I'm going to let you in on another secret, and we'll come back
to this. I'll let you in on just a little personal history of
the two of us. You'll probably dig in and find a bunch of stuff.
If you do hear it from the media, I'll tell you now, about 80
or 90 percent of it is totally inaccurate. But I don't say that
in defense - you believe what you want to believe. Ti and
I as individuals at the beginning were very, very moral individuals
in our own standing. We felt like we were moral people. We felt
like we lived very correctly, as far as how to treat our families,
how to treat our neighbors, how to abide by the law. I could
remember if I even had a friend that smoked a joint, and pot was
illegal, I'd have wanted to stop having anything to do with him
because he was doing something that was illegal. So, we were
that preoccupied with trying to live in a way that wouldn't upset
the world of Caesar, so to speak. I mean, when Jesus said, "Give
to Caesar what belongs to Caesar," it's the same thing. 
In leaving this world to go to our Father's Kingdom, you try the
best you can to not make a mess of the world that you're leaving.
Yet in spite of it, sometimes we make a mess. And I'm going
to let you in on a mess that I made when Ti and I were awakening.
<p>
At one time when we'd run out of money, one of our students said,
"Look, I've got this perfectly good credit card here that
I'd like for you to use for awhile if you can use it to help you
buy gas." So, we used it for a short time, and then we got
to feeling uncomfortable about it. And just about the time we
got to feel uncomfortable about it, we learned, by a circumstance
which I'll tell you about in a few minutes, that the card had
been reported stolen by the husband of the student, who had said,
"It's a good credit card and I want you to use it."
But things were happening at the home of that student that we
weren't aware of. In our naivete we thought, "Well,
thanks a lot, we'll buy a little gas with this credit card for
a period of time."
<p>
Another thing that happened is that Ti and I were in St. Louis
at midnight when the comet Kohoutek came along, and our car, the
little old dumpy car that we had reduced ourselves to, died. 
When we left the world, we both had shiny new cars and we wore
them out. One we left to be repossessed, because our heads were
so captivated by what we were doing, we knew that we couldn't
take the responsibility for it. We couldn't even stop to think
about it. And here we were in a snow storm in the middle of the
night in St. Louis, as I said, the night Kohoutek came. And I
had a credit card of my own in my pocket that we knew was good.
We hadn't used it, and it was in good standing. I pulled out
the credit card and I said, "Look, let's rent a car. Let's
have faith that the bill will be taken care of and we'll get on
our way and we won't just be stranded. Here we are, we've got
no car at all, and hardly funds for doughnuts." So, we rented
this car and then we went on. 
<p>
Now, you can say, "What are you doing"? Well, we were
going from this little minister to that little minister, to this
TV preacher to that one, and we were saying, "We don't know
why we have this information, but we feel that we've been sent
from the Kingdom of Heaven to tell you this and this and this."
And most of the time what they would do is listen politely, and
maybe offer us a meal and say, "What you're saying tempts
me somehow or other as I sit here listening to you...." Or
what would happen to us many times is someone would listen to
us and they'd believe everything we'd say, and then they would
part from us, and go have dinner with their family or something
and come back with a completely different attitude, almost as
if to say, "Get out of here! You're upsetting my whole life.
I don't want to see you again!" Or they would say, "I
wish I could go with you, but I can't. I just can't destroy everything
that I am responsible for here." Well, we were so busy going
around naively telling what we were doing, that in this town of
Brownsville, Texas - right down on the Mexican border
- we thought, "Well, we're going to let our story out to the
media. We're going to tell the media what we know about the Kingdom
of Heaven and our having been sent from the Kingdom of Heaven
to help people get from here to there." And so we visited
with this reporter and we set up an appointment at a motel saying,
"We've got the most exciting, unusual, interesting story
to tell you that you have ever heard. So come and meet us at
this motel room and hear this story." Little did we know
that that reporter showed up, without telling us, with the sheriff
and deputies, and helicopters, and squad cars, because he thought
that we were going to tell him about a major drug deal. Because
that was the most important story that he could think of that
we could tell him. And when we were to meet with him, we suddenly
wondered, "What is this crowd of people around here? Who
are all these people"? And we were getting vibes that didn't
feel too good to us. So, we ran out of the room and ran to our
car, climbed in, and scooted down the street, because we couldn't
figure out what was happening here.
<p>
Next thing you knew, the helicopter came in on us with its megaphone
and was saying, "Pull off! Pull off!" I don't know
what they were saying. We were scared to death. Then we pulled
off and someone from the sheriff's department got in the car and
said, "I want to see your ID." And then they said,
"Well, we don't know what we've stopped you for, but we'll
tell you in a minute." What they stopped us for was because
they couldn't figure out why we were running. Because here they
were at the motel with the reporter, and so they were just holding
us while they were trying to figure out what they were holding
us for. In the meantime, they did a check on the license plate
on the car that we had rented. And yes, we had held the car past
the point that it should be returned, though we had written a
note saying to the charge card company and to the rental office,
"Don't worry, we'll return the car soon and the bill will
be paid, and we'll take good care of the car."
<p>
You can say, "That was really stupid and naive." Yes,
but we were so captivated with our task that we had blinders on
to Caesar's world. We were so caught up in our Father's world
and convinced that our Father wouldn't let anything happen to
us - that that bill would be paid and we didn't have to worry
about it. So, what happens, we get thrown in jail because in
the process of doing a search on us they learned that Ti's name
had been turned in for possession of stolen credit cards - the
credit card I mentioned to you earlier that someone had given
us. And they had just neglected to remove that charge when we
didn't use that card. It was an old charge, but was still in
the books. The student by that time had returned home to husband
many months prior to that. While we were held in the Brownsville
jail, they checked that out and they found out that the charges
had been dropped on the credit card. But in the process, they
moved Ti to another jail closer to the court where that credit
card charge would come up if it was still an active charge. And
they moved me to St. Louis. Regarding the charge card that I
had used - the rental car company had dropped the charges.
But I hate to tell you that an ambitious prosecuting attorney
in St. Louis thought, "This is an easy case. I can make
some points. This guy is as guilty as he can be of a stolen car."
So, here I went to jail in St. Louis. Well, within about 30
days, Ti was released from jail, and boy, did we learn a lot from
that experience.
<p>
I stayed in jail and the little public defender kept coming and
coming and coming, and saying, "Oh, this is a ricky-ticky
case and we'll have you out of here in no time, time served."
And I was thinking, "Goodness alive, what have we done!
Nobody's going to believe what we have to say about the Truth
because now we're criminals. We're socially unacceptable. And
who on Earth will listen to somebody that has a record"?
And the little public defender came in and said, "It's
Christmas time and I think that the judge will release you on
time served if you will plead guilty. Then we can get you out
in a hurry." I'd been in there 6 months when my case went
before the judge and I was sentenced to 4 months. So, they owe
me 2, in a sense. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I was in there
2 beyond my sentence, but I didn't get any credit for it. I'm
teasing, but the point I'm making is that Ti and I didn't want
to do <em>anything</em> that could be questionable because we didn't
want a bad light shed upon our credibility if we had this Truth
to offer. But the fact that Luci came in on us to see that we
were so quickly discredited, also acted as insurance for our continued
separation from the world.
<p>
We had a new rule now. It was<strong>:</strong> How tight can our rules be to
not again be questioned as far as legality or to not get in a
circumstance like this. Oh, I'm sure that if they want to find
fault with you bad enough, they can find it or make it up. I'm
sure the design has some loop holes in it that they could find
fault if they wanted to badly enough. But I'm telling you how
- and Jesus taught this - that "if you follow me,"
you will lose credibility, you will lose respect from those that
you had respect from. I'm afraid the same is true today. If
we end up being the instruments of <em>your</em> overcoming, of
<em>your</em> transition from the human kingdom to our Heavenly
Father's Kingdom, I'm afraid you will lose credibility. If there's
a reason for it to be lost, you will lose it. It can assist you.
It can become the positive. It can accelerate. It can ensure
your separation. Even though the situation always exists, as
I spoke of earlier, that we can say to any student, "If you
don't want to be here, if you aren't happy here, go and try to
recover whatever it is that you want to recover. We'll <em>help</em>
you try to recover it." Because, don't forget, in the same
way that when you go against our Father's Kingdom, His rule is
that, "If you acknowledge that you've gone against Me, if
you ask for forgiveness, then I'll take you back into My camp."'
<p>
Luci has a counterfeit of those same rules. Luci says that in
his world, if you come back and you apologize for having been
a part of that "cult" and having been duped into that
stupid venture of yours and if you come and say, "I did wrong,
I'll prove to you that I'll do right, I'll re-assume my responsible
position in this world," then he'll accept you back. He'll
let you back in that fold. I'm afraid I slipped and said "Luci"
again, and I said that I wouldn't. But you know I have to share
with you that in my conversations with Ti about that usage of
"Luci," I felt like Ti kept saying, "Oh come on,
Do, don't make such an issue of it. If anybody named Lucille
or Lucy hears you do that, they can take it in the right way."
So, I'm not sure that every time I use it, even though I'll try
not to, that I'll bother to correct it, because I'm going to assume
that it only applies within the context. There's certainly nothing
wrong with the name Lucy. Even Lucifer was "Prince of Light"
or "Son of Light." The name was a beautiful name. 
It's the <em>individual</em> that went awry that had that name.
Now, okay, who's next? Where do we go to on our next question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> If I've seen it right, I think we've covered the questions
on our first list, so if it seems right, would we go on to some
of the questions we had about overcoming?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Is overcoming a moral thing or is it a behavioral difference
between the two kingdoms?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I'm glad you asked that. I want to be sure that our listener
understands what this question is. She says, "Is overcoming
a moral thing"? What we mean by that is, "Is it right
to do this, is it wrong to do that, from a moral point of view"?
Well, the first illustration that comes to my mind is our classroom.
Frequently, every element that we have that can be used as a
tool in overcoming, every element that has been given to us, we
use as a tool in overcoming. Let's take consuming or food or
diet, as an illustration. We've used every diet in the book that
you can think of. And for the period of time that we're using
a particular diet, we do it seriously. We'd really think, "This
is a super diet!" We used a vegetarian diet, we used a fruitarian
diet - not just for a few days - we were vegetarians for
a long, long, long time. We were fruitarians for quite a while.
We did water fasts for an extended period of time. We've done
juice fasts. We've done Hippocrates' diet. We've done Gersen's
diet. We've done so many diets that, you know, we ran out of
books of diets to do. And while we were using each one of them,
we were devoted to it. We tried testing this and testing that.
But we then began to realize that what we were really doing was
<em>liberating</em> ourselves. We were liberating us from our own
likes and dislikes. So it wasn't that this was a right item to
consume and that was a wrong item to consume. But by not consuming
something that we really were hooked on, and consuming something
that we didn't particularly like, helped liberate us from our
likes and dislikes. And that happened again and again and again.
So the path of overcoming almost eventually works itself into
a path of "follow the leader" more than a path of overcoming.
Because it's not that necessarily "this is right" and
"this is wrong," though it may be more right than something
else, because it's more healthful. Eventually, it seems, that
everything we consume has a degree of unhealthiness to our vehicle.
<p>
Well, here those cards go, and there's that 10-second one, and
I don't know where this hour has gone, but we'll see you in our
next session as we'll get more into overcoming.
