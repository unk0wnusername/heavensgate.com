<strong>
Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 10
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr>

Here we are with Session 10. We took a few minutes break, and
the teleprompters are back with me. We said we were going to
try to fit in this one about indebtedness, and charge cards, and
related issues, since twice now we've been just about to start
on that, and then it was the end of that session.
<p>
A couple of things we mentioned in our little break were<strong>:</strong> getting
your house in order so that you are free of debts, and what's
the purpose in all of that? Not only is debt against the laws,
or rules, in the overcoming process, and not only what is the
purpose, but we need to realize that it applies most urgently
and more directly to those we're talking about as far as overcomers
are concerned. Because those houses <em>must </em>be gotten in
order, and they have to be gotten in order the right way. And
the only way we know, or the best we can do in trying to do it
the right way, is according to the instruction that we have received
on what is the right way. So, it's important to realize that
the issue is a <em>major </em>issue for those who see themselves
as beginning a major task in personal overcoming - trying
to complete that task to the satisfaction of our Father's Kingdom
before the end of the Age, or certainly have it underway enough
that we are safe in their hands and certainly in <em>their</em>
camp and not in the other camp. There was another point to that,
what was it?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Is it not leaving a mess behind?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes, that's a very important aspect of it, too. It is improper
for us to say, "Well, I'm just going to walk out the door
of my house. I'm going to pack my little suitcase, and I'm just
not going to worry about whom I owe this to and whom I owe that
to and how to take care of those issues." Even though the
possibility exists that as you might be in the process of trying
to leave quickly - because it's very important that if you go
this way that you do it very, very quickly - in spite of your
effort to not leave a mess that you might be forced to leave some,
and that's different. But for you to intentionally choose to
leave a mess and turn the responsibility over to others is not
the proper way to do it. If in the process you <em>end up</em>
with no choice because the circumstances close in on you so quickly,
then you have to do as you would in any circumstance that finds
yourself in that position. While you're trying to do what is
right and the circumstance changes, then you say, "I have
no choice, I must accept this as what is right, and I'll do the
best I can to proceed from here or seek help," and say to
us, "This happened, what can I do? It didn't happen the
way I thought it was going to be." Because it's true that
in the process of overcoming, as we receive the lessons that we
need, it never is the way we thought it was going to be. It always
is pretty traumatic, and it always takes a 90-degree turn that
becomes a shock to us, and we have to adjust to it and accept
it as, "Wow, that was just exactly the thing to help me take
a bigger leap forward that I didn't anticipate." So, we
have to be prepared for that. Remember that this lesson of being
free of indebtedness and not leaving a mess behind does apply,
or the first one certainly, more to those who are in the process
of trying to overcome. And not leaving a mess, of course, more
specifically would apply to those who are trying to overcome,
because they certainly would want to try to be more mature about
it and not just careless about it, but would seek help and guidance
in how to quickly sever those things without doing it in a wrong
way.
<p>
You know, one of the hardest things to do in this overcoming
process is to take menial instruction - instruction in areas that
you think that you can handle yourself - and to seek that instruction
from those who have done it before you. It's hard to make that
adjustment, and yet if you do this, if you take this step, if
you become a student of overcoming and we become teachers for
you, if these students become your teachers, at every step you
will increasingly learn, "Goodness, I could have avoided
this, I could have avoided that, if I had sought some help."
But each time you seek help, then comes the test of, "Could
I just have done it my way, or is it best to look to our Father's
Kingdom and those who have been assigned the task of helping me"?
That in itself would put you to a test each time. And even the
more you get into your overcoming, you become tested in ways that
are pretty tough and pretty serious, because then you want to
play a significant role as a teacher, or in the tasks that represent
the Kingdom of Heaven, whether they assign you to them or that
instruction is given or not.
<p>
So, those little illustrations that we used to read about of "putty
in their hands" and the patience that is required, and of
"wanting Your will, not mine," they keep reappearing
at times when we're unaware that it is <em>our will</em> that we
seek, thinking that this is just a step in fulfilling Their will.
Yet we will assume certain steps in fulfilling it that weren't
a part of Their will or our Father's will, in that chain. We
must realize the rules are different, the whole world is different,
the process is different, and the test is tremendous. We don't
mean to frighten you with it. It wouldn't work if your motivation
was because we were to scare the heck out of you or have you feel,
"If you don't do this, you're going to go to hell!"
I mean, that's childish. That should be beneath you and certainly
beneath us as teachers. We're trying to help you be objective
about it. These things don't apply to you if they don't speak
to you. That's kind of hard to understand, too. If this isn't
something you're to do, then it is improper for us to say that
they apply to all. If you're a part of our classroom, the rules
are strict, but if you are not, what you do is no concern of ours.
However, no one can get to the Kingdom of Heaven without applying
the same behavior that we apply. But we're not judging them<strong>;</strong>
He hasn't assigned us to them. He's assigned us to those who
say, "I identify. This is what I know I must do. I know
that you know things that I am turned on to that I must pursue."
<p>
You know, the way it's designed here at the end of the Age, and
as far as our assignment in this task is concerned, it's quite
different than some of the motivation was 2000 years ago. A lot
of the followers were motivated by seeming "miracles"
that Jesus would do - the fishes and loaves feeding multitudes,
and water to wine, and healing the blind and the sick, and raising
from the dead. These things were, my goodness! they were all
used to try to help those young souls to look to this individual
who was the vessel and say, "What can I learn from you"?
But He soon began to realize that what they wanted for the most
part was more miracles, that they really didn't care about the
information of overcoming, and following Him in the difficult
task of overcoming the world and becoming a student and humbling
themselves and going to our Father's Kingdom according to the
route that was given to Him, a step at a time, day by day, in
the way it was designed.
<p>
But back to how it's different. We haven't been given any powers.
We don't have any instruction to do any healing or any miracles,
even though I know that certainly the Next Level could do them
in a snap through us if we are vessels of theirs, because they
can do just about anything they want to do just by putting the
thought in motion, and they could certainly do it with you or
with these students or with us. We have more sense than to limit
them.
<p>
In a sense, at the end of the Age the test is even greater because
no one is whetting your appetite or giving you things that you
could easily be motivated to do at certain stages. It's almost
as if the Kingdom of Heaven is saying, "Well here's the end
of the Age. You should be beyond that." And also the road
is a little tougher. If these souls have come back who may have
even been with Him at that time and they're coming back to complete
what they must do, the road is tougher. It's harder to identify.
It requires more effort on your part. It requires more thirst,
it requires a stronger pump, it requires a more thorough cleansing.
If you're going to get to our Father's Kingdom and be able to
stay there and not need to return to the human kingdom unless
assigned, then the list is long and the requirements are stiff.
If you have truly graduated, you're going to take a vehicle (like
we have said before, wear a "suit of clothes") that
doesn't even have the capacity to do a lot of things that humans
have to do. Not that you would want to do them, but it has also
many things and capacities and functions to do (as we've talked
about - mental communication, and the missing of certain
organs, and certain capabilities to do things). We don't want
to try to entice you by saying that you could appear or disappear,
or that you could move from here to there in space in a matter
of a moment just by techniques that are natural to them, just
as natural to them as an elementary chemistry or a physics classroom.
Okay, I think enough said on that. What's the next question
on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Is this a good time to talk about our lifestyle as it
relates to a classroom?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> As good a time as any. Our lifestyle as it relates to a classroom
I believe we've discussed that we do not currently have a physical
place where we can go and where we have protection and seclusion<strong>;</strong>
it's not that easy. I'm not sure we wouldn't try to take advantage
of it for as long as we were capable of taking advantage of it,
if one existed, but it doesn't. Therefore, our classroom is wherever
we are, whatever numbers there are of our classroom in that situation,
applying all the lessons, staying in close touch, and receiving
instruction. And believe it or not, the design that has been
given to us, the help that Ti receives and feeds to me, is just
unbelievable how appropriately it can be applied to the circumstances
that we have existed in, that allowed us to at times be together,
at times to be separate, at times to be in several units.
<p>
If we've received instruction to make these tapes, to do these
sessions and to put them out, then what's the process? We do
it a step at a time, and then we get new instructions. And therefore,
we <em>trust</em>, because everything else has worked out as we
trusted it. We trust that it would all work out for <em>you</em>.
It would require <em>your</em> trust. If you are sincerely seeking
our Father's Kingdom, and certainly if we are permitted to serve
in the capacity of helping you get there, then I can't imagine
that our Father wouldn't take advantage of the opportunity and
say, "I have these Representatives there that are doing that
process of change, and here are some whom we gave them instruction
to be in contact with and receive information on how to get from
here to there. So, I certainly wouldn't leave them if they are
serious and if they have that potential."
<p>
And so we believe the likelihood is there for you, but whether
or not it materializes still depends on you - whether the
need will exist - it will only exist if you respond. Each
step of closeness that we have is determined by how we respond
to what is given to us, whether it's a lesson, an exercise in
restraint, or getting rid of our own mind. It's how we respond
that pleases or displeases our Father. It's not because we make
a better cake batter or that we'd be a better driver of an automobile
or, even though we try to do all those things to the best of our
ability. But things that could be done in the human kingdom,
having a better brain (what humans would call a better brain),
doesn't necessarily make us a better "responder." It's
our <em>yielding</em> - not being someone who is constantly preoccupied
with how <em>I</em> want to serve and what <em>I</em> want to do,
but someone who says, "If I'm not getting assignments, then
it's in order to give me a chance to let the information that
I have been given to mature. I'll stay alert and keen and do
all the things that are assigned to me as best I can. If those
seem to be thin, then it's my test of patience, because I have
to trust what has been given to me from our Father's Kingdom.
I will be patient and it's Their will that I want." If
I respond that way, then that's my <em>response</em> to that situation.
I'm always graded on my <em>response</em>, not my proficiency or
my skill as far as tasks are concerned. It's <em>how</em> we perform
the task and how we perform even if we don't get a task. Therefore,
it's our response to the lessons that are given to us, or sometimes
even the lessons that aren't given to us that are still situations
that invite our response. All right, what's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, shall we talk more about physical addictions and
habits?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes, we have to get to that topic, so we might as well.
What's first on your little list of physical addictions and habits?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, there's drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. Needless to say, there's
no place in this classroom or in an overcoming process for things
that would change our perception, or alter our consciousness.
The principle there is not that alcohol is taboo, it's that alcohol
is an interference, it doesn't work for us.
<p>
Any who have worked in chemistry as it related to medicine certainly
know that a wrong dosage of a medicine can kill you. To the other
extreme, it may have no effect. And yet the right dosage can
be the thing that can help you very much. Now, in the human world,
some of those dosages are in question because they might help
one thing but then cause certain side effects that would be difficult.
As lessons are given to us in our Father's Kingdom, the dosages
that we would receive are examined, and we may not see that dosage
again and may not even see that item again. We're trying to help
you understand how important dosages are, even in what we consume,
whether it's the amount of broccoli we consume or the amount of
wheat items that we would consume or the vegetable juice or whatever
we might consume. There's no <em>"this is right to consume
and this is wrong to consume."</em>
I imagine there are certain things that are wrong. I can't imagine
there would ever be any justification in our classroom to consume
marijuana or morphine or heroin, or certainly mind-altering drugs
or things that would pretty obviously be only designed to alter
our state of consciousness. But it's important to understand
that dosages are important, and that we're not to consume things
that would pose any significant danger to us. We don't receive
instruction to do that, even though we learn lessons about overconsuming
and underconsuming. And that's why we've been put through all
kinds of tests, including water fasts and juice fasts and strict
vegetarian diets where we consumed only vegetables for a long
period of time, and then vegetables and fruits, and then just
fruits only for a period of time. We've been through all these
things and we've learned lessons at each one of them. And we
learn what serves as maybe a cleaner fuel, what might last a little
longer. It's funny that in a lot of our testing at times we've
seemed like we needed sweets. I don't know if it's a type of
brain food, but we need certain types of sweets. Sometimes the
fruits will satisfy that need, but we learn that the health food
route doesn't always jive with the instructions that we get, though
it does jive to some extent for certain periods of time. Don't
forget, the name of our game is Capital, neon-light, <em>FLEXIBLE</em>!
Therefore, we are put through things again and again and again,
because we don't want to get hooked on something new or decide
in our own mind, "This is the right thing we've got to stick
to." As soon as we do that, then we get instruction to stop
it and we go to something else, and we're so confused because
we thought, "Boy we thought that was really the best fuel
that we could get." But certainly tobacco doesn't seem to
have any place, as in smoking or chewing or in any other form
that I'm aware of. Alcohol might be used in a very light dosage
in certain circumstances (on <em>rare </em>occasion) as it's been
given as instruction. Not that we see anything wrong with sometimes
getting instruction to use it as flavoring in something that we
might be baking.
<p>
I think we've covered the drugs, how they would be inappropriate.
But, in a sense, when we have instruction to take certain herbs
for certain symptoms we might have, or even aspirin, in a sense
we're taking certain low dosages of things that might help us
with a particular symptom, as a band-aid. What the world has
become certainly, and we've discussed how those food items - those
fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds, and so forth - what
they are now is nothing of what they were 6000 years ago, at the
beginning of this Age. They've been so mistreated, and they've
lost their nutrition, and we've altered them genetically so, to
make them grow faster so we can get them to the market faster.
We make them prettier and we put them through certain processes
so that they won't spoil, and in the process we put things in
them that we don't want, and we take nutrition out. So, we can't
go back, theoretically, and just consume what was in the Garden
of Eden, because we don't have those fruits any longer, even though
some of those fruit items might seem to be here, but they don't
have the same nutritional value. And then it's so hard to find
the good ones, and even the good ones aren't good enough this
day and time, they're so lacking. Even though we use them, we
keep fruits and vegetables relatively high in our diet fairly
consistently, but we don't always have them just to see if it
matters to us, if it's going to alter our condition or if we are
going to override it. We'll be put to tests to see if we're going
to override it. This is just to help you understand some of the
principles as instructions come down, as it relates to our disciplines
and things that we might consume. What's next on that list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I think we mentioned the coffee syndrome. And also what
is really satisfying? How do we define what's satisfying to the
vehicle?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, the thing we need to understand about coffee, for example,
is that coffee is certainly so unnecessary to us, and such a common
habit of the human kingdom, that we could pretty much guess that
it would be removed from our diet because we don't want things
to trigger old habits. We don't need it, but, here again, we
might use it in flavoring certain things. It's not that coffee
is taboo and it's nix and you're going to go to hell if you drink
a cup of coffee. If it's some habit that we had, then why would
we get instruction to do it. And if it was a bigger habit and
it covered more people in any given classroom, then it would be
more likely not to reappear in our menu, even though it has appeared
as flavoring a time or two. There's another little funny influence
that goes with coffee, and also with tea, and that is a lot of
people get into a mindset. I can remember in our early campground
in Wyoming where some went around with their coffee cup or their
tea cup almost as if it was an extension of their hand. And in
the morning, they would have that and say, "Well, you know,
this is what I am...this is just me. I just can't wake up, I'm a
night person, I'm not a morning person, I need my cup of coffee
or I need my tea." And that's all you need to say to the
Next Level for it not to be a part of your consuming or your experiment.
Because if you need it, then you're limited, and if you're a
night person, you're limited. At times we have had teas. Since
back in the campground at times we've had iced tea because it
didn't seem that people were that hooked on having to have it
all the time. And pop we did away with for a while, and then
we brought it back. But we would try to handle it in a careful
way so that people didn't feel like they had to have it and identify
with it. But all this came as instruction as to how often to
put it in our menu, and how much to put in our menu, and it became
an important test for some. Each time one item was a test for
one individual or two or five or ten, it also then was not a test
for others whom it didn't matter to. Anytime it doesn't matter
to you, then you have <em>flexibility</em>, and that's the reason
these various lessons are given to us, so that we don't need them.
We know that we can survive without particular items. And if
we have them, we're not going to get hooked on them, but if we
begin to want them on a regular basis, we're in danger of being
hooked on them. So, that's pretty much what we could count on
losing then if we began to expect it and want it or feel the need
of it, because we don't need anything. We need one thing. We
need our Father's Kingdom and the relationship to it that He has
given to us, and the lessons that He gives to us in order to get
closer to Him so that we can become rightful heirs - rightful
heirs as children in His Kingdom. What's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I'm not sure if you feel you've touched enough
on redefining satisfying consuming.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> No, I didn't and I'm glad you brought it up. Satisfying consuming.
I think we measure satisfying more by "Does the fuel work"?
And probably we would say it's even more satisfying in some ways
if it doesn't take a whole lot of that fuel, even though we've
gone through experimentation where we would consume a whole lot
of certain fuel in order to get the nutrients of it. (Like we
said earlier, fruits and vegetables have become so depleted, the
vegetables probably even more so than the fruits.) And I remember
when we were just having vegetables, it seemed like we just had
massive amounts of vegetables before we would be sustained, because
it would move through us so quickly and our energy didn't seem
to quite hold up and our appetite was not quite satisfied. It
seems that the pattern has kind of been to consume what works
as a fuel, and what has the energy we want.
<p>
We're careful about certain things that we consume. For example,
if we're consuming meat products, we try to get meat products
that don't have hormones in them (within reason, assuming our
budget can afford them). We don't want to take the chance that
by ingesting those hormones they might have some effect on our
hormones, and have us deal with certain things that we don't feel
the need of dealing with. So, that's a consideration in all items.
We don't want to deal with something that would alter our consciousness.
We don't want to deal with certain hormones. As we get these
instructions, we feel that the consideration is partially how
would it affect us and our chemistry since we are overcomers.
But we are interested in the fuel that would sustain us. If
we vibrate at a different level, to use one kind of terminology,
or we participate in different behavior than the average human
out there, then we can have a lot more of what we would call more
<em>refined</em> or less <em>dense</em> or less <em>animal</em> type
consuming because we don't vibrate on that level. We don't have
that behavior. That doesn't mean that muscle has gone out. We
still need a certain amount of muscle, so we consume things that
would feed the muscle, and from time to time consume certain muscles
(i.e., meat).
<p>
But I'm sure that a question for some of you out there who are
listening to us who thought that on your path of enlightenment
that it was so valuable to become a strict vegetarian, or maybe
from your point of view of animal rights thought, "How could
we justify consuming animals at all, at any given time"?
And we had to deal with those same questions when it became instruction
for us to consume those items. And we realized that we can't
question that instruction, any more than when the Lord gave Moses
certain instructions to go and kill the fatted calf in celebration
for something in His relationship with those individuals. I mean,
that was an instruction, and they did it, and probably they were
put to the test because that fatted calf was such a precious possession
to them that they hated to do it in that way. They probably would
have rather had the <em>old</em> cow, but our Father doesn't do
what we want. He lets us be fed by our own desires if we're willing
to have them satisfied by the wrong side of the fence or the kingdom
or corporation that is not of His Kingdom. But we can't question
those things. We can't tell Jesus and His disciples that they
were wrong if they were wearing sandals that were made of leather
or if some of their outer garments had some animal product in
it. Even though we have to give a certain amount of respect to
humans who have that mindset. But when they have that mindset,
they're concerned with death of the <em>vehicle</em>, and this is
where we get into a thing that we're concerned with<strong>:</strong> death of
the soul.
<p>
We're on a lesson plan in overcoming the world that has all kinds
of elements in it that put us to the question, and to the test,
that previously we might have thought that we had gotten knowledge
about and we wouldn't ever eat animal products again - we
wouldn't wear them and we wouldn't need to consume them. And
then we get instruction to do it and we say, "Well, at this
point, does that mean I turn away from my teacher, I turn away
and I can't go any further because I'm not going to do that"?
And frequently that was the reason the test was given, and some
could at that point turn away, it would mean that much to them.
I mean, is it worth it? Is it worth it? Even when Jesus returned
to them after having risen from the tomb, He ate a piece of <em>fish</em>
and a honeycomb. And earlier He had them multiply fish in order
to give it to the crowd. Whoops - animal products!
How do we deal with that if we thought it was "spiritual
advancement"? Don't forget, that's counterfeit. If you're
following instructions, you have to examine, "Is this instruction,
is this a Representative"? And if you don't know, then what
do you do? You say to the most high God, "If this is right
for me, help me to know it because I am willing to go a step further.
I want Your will not mine. I don't want to be restricted by
my preconceived notions of what is moral or what is the issue
here as far as animal rights, or whether I should consume any
animal products."
<p>
It's true that certain animal products give us difficulties in
other ways. We find that we probably have more difficulties with
milk products at times, even though we get instructions to use
them in this way or use them in that way, and we have to deal
with the problems. We've never really wiped them out of our diet
permanently, but we've learned, for the most part, to reduce them.
And we might use nutmilks or other things because of the vehicle's
response to those things, and we do take into account each individual's
vehicle's response. Then as I receive feedback from the classroom,
or the sections of the classroom, then I take it to my Older Member
and say, "What do we do about this"? And then I wait
for an answer of what to do about it and how to approach the next
lesson as far as symptoms of the vehicles, and what we might consume,
and the effect it might have upon our vehicles. Our Father's
Kingdom does not need anything in the human kingdom to consume.
Our Father has a different kind of fuel and doesn't need human
fuel. Therefore, if we're trying to get into our Father's Kingdom,
then the closer and closer and closer we get, the more the human-designed
fuel and animals of this Earth's Age become less compatible to
our vehicles. And we have to try to override that incompatibility.
Therefore, it does us a lot of good. We can see why they've
switched us from this to this to this to this, because they all
seem to have some degree of ill effect on us, and then we counter
that with not having too much of this and moving on to that and
whatever they give us in instruction. This might help you understand
a little bit of how they relate to us and some of the tests that
we're put to in their relationship to us concerning consuming.
<p>
What's the next question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Would you like to talk about the psychological addictions
and habits, like negativity and moodiness, and judging others.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes, it's valuable that we talk about those issues because
they are as important, I could say easily, if not more important,
but I don't know how to weigh which ones are more important.
Negativity, moodiness. Negativity, listening to anything that
could discourage me in this task of overcoming. Or when I receive
instruction not to listen to certain things, and I continue to
listen to them. In my secret, I am holding an ace in the hole,
or whatever you want to call it - I'm secretly testing my
<em>teachers. </em>Even though this is a teacher speaking, you're
not really testing the teachers. You're really, at that moment,
for that duration, saying, "I'm going to put the whole Kingdom
of Heaven on trial as it relates to the one that you have assigned
for me, because I'm going to let that one you've assigned to me
be the object of my test or my trial." If they say, "If
you do this and this, then it can help you not accept that negativity,"
but I continue to listen to negativity that could overcome me,
then I'm not breaking that habit. I am choosing to continue to
listen to doubt or discouragement. Lucifer comes in and says
things like<strong>:</strong> "This isn't really what you want to do, why
don't you go out and serve the humans in this way or that way."
And he can say, "You can see something accomplished with your time.
Where this, you're off isolated and who can be positively affected
by this isolation? How much good are you doing the human kingdom?
Are you really helping them that much"? That's because Lucifer doesn't
understand what you're doing for the human kingdom.
<p>
As this classroom goes up a notch, it pulls the whole rest of
that human kingdom closer and tests them that much more to give
them an opportunity to move up. But Lucifer forgets that, because
he wants - he <em>needs</em> - members. He also does not want us
to succeed at overcoming. It is par for the course, it is on
every student's mind to fight off negativity, discouragement,
things that would put us down as individuals. And that discouragement,
if we listen to it, also becomes moodiness. For the time we're
not listening to it, then, we might be happy. And for the time
we are listening to it, we're more shy and more pulled away.
Our face is dragging and our ability to serve is interfered with
because of our countenance. Everyone around us can read what's
going on in our countenance, and they try to help us out of it.
And we insist that it's not happening, even though they can tell
us that they <em>know</em> that it is happening. So, then they
can't try to help us beyond trying to offer help to us for awhile
- because we're forcing someone to do something that they don't
want to do. Then the next question might be, "Are you sure
you want to be here? Because you're unhappy. I'm not sure you
want to be here." And at that point you have to say, "Whoops,
am I really unhappy? Then maybe I shouldn't be here." That
opens the door that much bigger to Satan's argument and tests
us, because at that time we've got an opportune time to leave
and drop all this and go and tend to what he says is more significant
for us. And then we get right down to the nitty gritty. And
we have to re-examine<strong>:</strong> is this everything we were looking for?
Are we going to gamble on losing it? Are we going to take a
chance on losing it in order to go do the things that we used
to do, or that we felt we didn't have a chance to do in the world
before joining the class? Neither one of those perceptions would
come to your mind if you had not already displeased the Next Level
and they had taken away the ability for you to see us for who
we are. The whole process of overcoming is testing. Negativity
is a major item we have to deal with. Negative thinking, listening
to things of discouragement that would put us down, moodiness,
and what else?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> There was judging yourself and others as well as degrading
yourself.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Goodness, <em>Judge not that ye be not judged</em>. I mean,
if it is true that my Heavenly Father exists and if He has appointed
my Older Member as my Older Member, and if I am a younger member
to that Older Member and thereby an Older Member to you, if that
is true and you misjudge me, then only He has the right to judge
you or have you judge yourself, by judging. Who really judged
though? I'm afraid that what I believe the truth to be is that
<em>you</em> at that point have not misjudged us. You have listened
to misjudgment from those who are such aggressors in feeding you
misinformation, and then you have joined their forces in misjudging.
It's very important. It's just as important that you not misjudge
your own overcoming, your own capacity at overcoming, not let
influences or thoughts of misinformation pull you down and discourage
you, because that happens again and again. Your performance can
be poor and your response can be poor, and you can say, "I'm
never going to get this, others are getting this and I can see
them moving up and I'm not moving up." It's very easy to
listen to negativity and it's difficult to turn a negative into
a positive. But we have a plan that was given to us and it says,
"If I will expose anything that is of that wrong household,
acknowledge it and expose it, it can be taken from me, I can be
free of it, I can be not responsible for it."
<p>
If I listen to negativity in overcoming, I'm "sinning"
- I'm doing something against my Father's House. I am separating
from my Father's House and the appointee that He has designated.
That "sin" itself has to be taken from me - another
note taken by His Representative, who says, "Just acknowledge
that what you're doing is self-destructive to you and acknowledge
what it was and we'll get past it. Don't worry about it. Forget
it - it's gone, it doesn't exist." Then we have to drop
it. We have to <em>forget it!</em> if we expect to eradicate
it. Lucifer does not want us to forget anything negative, even
if we make progress and make progress. He wants us to remember
it. He will even say, "It'll do you good to remember those
things as lessons," so that you will say, "I learned
those lessons." It doesn't do any good to dwell on the negative.
When you acknowledge it, and you admit it and you say, "I
want to go on," that's the same thing as asking for forgiveness.
"I want to go on. Here it was, this was wrong. I can see
how it was destructive to me. I don't want it, I want to go on.
Will you accept me still as a student? Will the Next Level accept
me"? Because all your teacher can say is, "Well, I'm
afraid I've got to go ask my Older Member, and we'll see."
And that usually doesn't take much time. Sometimes, on the spot,
the Older Member can speak through the vessel and say, "It's
done, it's behind you. It's gone. You can forget about it!"
And we can start afresh. And if you do that, if you refuse to
remember it again and you take a major step forward, then that
step forward will be a part of your new structure. But if you
remember it, you can step easily back into it. You will remind
yourself of that position and you will remain in that condition
as long as that's where you put yourself. If you refuse to put
yourself there, then you're ready for the next step and a new
position and a new person. Each step can be a new person. Each
time you get rid of something, you're a brand new person.
<p>
Now, it's up to each class member, each time a student takes
a step forward, not to take their fellow class members where that
fellow class member once was. They've got to make that adjustment,
they've got to give that class member credit for change. If they
want to help them change, they've got to give them credit for
change and not hold anything against them for where they were.
But the easiest way for your class members to accept that is
when they see in you that you have made that change, and not that
they have to wait. It's <em>their</em> responsibility to give you
credit for that change. It's <em>your</em> responsibility to demonstrate
that that change has taken place. And these are basic elements
in overcoming.
<p>
Who's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Did we want to talk a little bit about deceit and dishonesty.
I think you've mentioned it's like a neon light in the Next Kingdom
Level.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> It's such a festered boil, few things could be equal to it.
It's so bad to be deceitful and to be dishonest, because for
the time that you are deceitful, on any little item, no matter
how minute it is, it increases. Because first it might have just
been that item, and then another item is added of dishonesty,
then another item is added - "I'm not keeping my slate clean as
I promised that I would."
And items continue to mount because those forces are saying, "It's
not that important, you don't have to worry about it, you don't
have to be embarrassed by recognizing that this was negative,
this was beneath you to do that thing." And you want to
expose it. Exposure is a wonderful thing! It's like getting
relief. But if influences say, "Don't expose, hold it."
Then you immediately become dishonest, deceitful, and difficult
things mount. When difficult things mount, what does it take
to get me to the next step? An equally more difficult test.
I can't move forward if I'm permitting an indebtedness to occur
without something just as equally difficult. The step up would
have been a very little one if I had exposed it at the time that
we had instruction to expose it, and I moved up. It wouldn't
have been that difficult. But the longer I delay it and the more
things that begin to mount because I'm getting further and further
in my privacy, and in putting it off and in not doing the things
that were given to me to do, then in order to move from there
to here, it becomes super tough and major! At that point, it's
hard to prove that you want to change and move forward to those
who help your Older Members, those of our Father's Kingdom, who
in their daily activities do a lot of this work that the teachers
certainly don't do. And they will have things occur to you that
will put you in the position of that test. I mean, most of the
work happens from them. The classroom situation, what happens
with the teachers, is almost small in comparison to what Members
of our Father's Kingdom literally are doing for you and the things
that they subject you to and the circumstances you're put in that
permit you the opportunity to move ahead and conquer.
<p>
Now this, of course, gets into another issue of what are some
of the activities of our Father's Kingdom, which we'll talk about
when we get to that question. I'm going to try not to make that
jump. Who's next, or did we not finish that one?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I think there are a few other things, like gossip and
confidentiality and familiarity. I didn't know if you wanted
to talk about those things?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay. Boy! These are really deadly sins, these are really
negative things that can breed just as much trouble as dishonesty
and deceit. You said gossip and confidentiality. Confidentiality
to me is the same thing as deceit. It's finding someone else
to join me in my deceit, because if I'm entering into something
with someone else that I wouldn't enter into with my teacher,
or other members of the class, then I'm creating an unnatural
circumstance there. It's certainly less than objective or more
than objective, whichever way you want to look at it, and it becomes
a relationship that was not an assignment. Therefore, I have
gone against the instruction. I am no longer a flexible crew
member that is objective. I am giving into the desire of the
flesh or the influences that are triggering that flesh by wanting
some kind of special relationship. I've conned somebody who could
really be a partner to me. We can have our little confidentialities
and our little gossip. That makes the partnership absolutely
impossible and deadly to both individuals if they participate
in it, until they learn how not to participate in it. So, we
talked about gossip, confidentiality, and...?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Familiarity?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Familiarity. Familiarity is pretty much the same thing, except
a lot of times familiarity is still a withdrawal symptom from
needing a close attachment with another individual. I know it
sounds tough, and Luci makes this sound absolutely ridiculous
when it comes out our mouths, but our Father's Kingdom says, "If
you're going to overcome this world and come into my Kingdom,
you're going to be only familiar with one thing, and that's my
Kingdom. You're only going to love one thing, that's my Kingdom.
As far as a physical familiarity with anyone, the only familiarity
you're going to have, the only confidant you can have, the only
one you can talk to about things that you might want to talk to
are your check partners, within procedures, and your Older Member.
That's the way we have designed it, and if you try to change
those, then to that degree you're going against the lesson plan."
And you have to mistrust the lesson plan to participate in those
things.
<p>
When we don't know that we're going against the lesson plan,
the methods that they give us always help surface that we have

done something that we didn't know we were doing when we did it.
And then it becomes another kind of test - CAN I take criticism,
or can I have it brought to my attention, or do I want to say,
"Oh no, you're taking me from a wrong level"? Because
a test that comes to us so frequently is, "If I'm really
flexible, then I take what is given to me as correction and believe
it and apply it." It's very important that you understand
something here, and that is even if it was misinformation, even
if it didn't apply, the technique works of examining it and saying,
"Well, I must not have seen what was going on here."
In other words, I want to take the blame, I want to say, "You're
right," even though influences and my brain might say, "I
wasn't wrong, it was the other person that was wrong here."
But if I say, "I must have been doing something wrong or
you wouldn't have responded the way you did, or the others wouldn't
have seen me in that light," and if I take the blame and
assume it is something that I did wrong, then I stand on the
path of eliminating whatever it was that I did because of my willingness
to examine it. What harm would come to me even if I had not been
wrong? But if I defend myself, then I'm taking more than a 50-50
chance that I was not being flexible. I am choosing to believe
my own mind instead of the mind that is being given to me through
my Teachers and through my helpers and through my partnerships.
<p>
Believe it or not, none of the students likes to hurt each other.
Why would somebody come and accuse you of something? Because
they like to hurt you? I mean, Heavens! If they aren't past
that by now, I don't know where they are. Frequently, we have
to fuss at a partner for not helping a partner because a partner
will say, "The partner doesn't bring up things to me, I don't
feel like I'm making any progress." We confront the partner
and they say, "Well, I just hate to bring it up because it
might be difficult for them to deal with." You're not helping
someone if you don't bring it up. If they've solicited help,
if they've said, "Would you please bring it up, I want to
know about it," and you say, "Well, but I don't want
the confrontation," then you're no good to them. You can't
really help them in that circumstance. So, it's very important
that we be willing to help them. When we say to them that you
might have been doing this behavior or that one, and it might
be inappropriate, we preface it by saying, "I could be wrong,
I could be completely off base by what I see, but the thought
occurred to me and we have a procedure that when the thought does
occur to us to bring it up. And so if the shoe fits, wear it<strong>;</strong>
if it doesn't, I'm sure glad because I don't like to bring things
up." And it works.
Of course, it can put the person to the test and they can say,
"How outrageous for you to bring that up!" Or they can say,
"Goodness, I wasn't aware of that, I'll examine it, and I'll
try to apply it." The neat thing is that if we can shift into
the gear of assuming they were right or it wouldn't have been
brought to our attention, 99 times out of a 100, we'll find out
exactly how they were right and how we were guilty. It didn't
mean anything, it wasn't any big deal. The most important thing
was for us to become flexible, for us to examine it, and if we
take the blame, what harm has happened if the shoe didn't fit.
Do we feel embarrassed, are we too concerned about being embarrassed
by it? We have to overcome that, too - that's just another
thing that we have to overcome. Boy, we're getting into the nitty
gritty. This is part of what goes on every day in the classroom,
again and again. So, I felt that it would be only fair to you
to see. What are we doing? We're trying to shorten your days,
we're trying to help you not enter a possible classroom situation
only to say, "Boy if I had known that was going to happen,
I wouldn't have started this."
<p>
There's that 10-second card, and we'll see you in our next session.
