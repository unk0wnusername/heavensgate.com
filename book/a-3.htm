To those who have not yet done much serious study of this
type of information and might be inclined to criticize our
position and that of our Teachers, our Older Members, Ti
(pronounced "Tee") and Do (pronounced "Doe"), consider this:
Upon what information do you base your opinions?  How many
hours have you sat with them getting to know them for
yourself?  All too often humans form quick opinions out of
ignorance because of having had neither the opportunity nor
the time to examine the facts for themselves.  We wanted to
issue a word of caution since it is our sincere belief that
the Kingdom of God (the Level Above Human) will judge you
according to how you judge this information.<p>
<p>
I <em>have</em> sat many hours with them.  I have found no
fault in them, only a depth I have only begun to comprehend
as I continue to learn from and observe them.  Despite the
younger age of the vehicle (body) I am wearing, I cannot
even begin to keep up with Do's enthusiasm, his abundance of
energy, his positive attitude, his amazing ability to
accomplish tasks quickly, and so many other positive
attributes that go way beyond those of any other person I
have ever come across.  What is more, I have also had the
extreme honor of being in the physical presence of Do's
Older Member, Ti.  I was able to observe how they worked
together as a Next Level partnership, which cannot compare
to <em>anything</em> I have ever observed in the human world
as people work together.  And I have been blessed to enjoy
their wonderful sense of humor.  But most of all, I have
felt the incredible caring and patience they have always
shown me when I so many times fell short in my efforts to
become more like them.  They always had far more faith in me
than I had in myself, and I will be eternally grateful for
that.<p>
<p>
To those who say my Older Members were on an ego trip, I say
you have never witnessed the many times they displayed their
discomfort with being in the position they were in, desiring
only to be simple servants of the Kingdom of Heaven, but
happy to serve in whatever task they were given.  I have
witnessed Do grow and change after Ti left the human female
vehicle He used for this task and returned to the Next Level.
Do's <em>only</em> pleasure is in pleasing Ti and ridding
himself of any ego that would prevent him from becoming more
like Ti.  I have witnessed this many times and know it to be
true, but I cannot prove it to anyone.  The Next Level
designed it so that proof of who Their Representatives
are comes only to those who take the step of dropping all
of their human ties and seek only to be a part of the Kingdom
of God, through the ones they send.  The lower forces have
made their primary effort the "drugging" of the inhabitants
of this garden/planet with misinformation so that they would
act and think in ways contrary to Next Level ways.  You must
give up the very things the masses accept as natural to the
human condition before you can sober up enough to realize
how drunk on lies and self-destructive behavior this
civilization has become.<p>
<p>
If you believe our Older Members were ever interested in
financial gain, where are the bank accounts in either of
their names?  Where are the automobiles or properties they
hold?  If you are convinced they show one face to their
students but live and act quite differently in their
privacy, where is one shred of evidence that this is the
case?  I know that as high as the standards are that Ti and
Do have always required of their students, they maintain
even higher standards for themselves around the clock.  Do
utilizes his every private moment away from us as a precious
opportunity to raise those standards and thereby become even
more pleasing to his Older Member (Ti).  We all choose to
live as we do because we <em>like</em> Next Level ways -
they are the only thing that means anything to us.  Human
ways are an abomination to us because we have outgrown them
and they are not appropriate in the genderless world to
which we aspire.<p>
<p>
Do you presume to judge our Teachers based upon "their
past"?  First of all, Ti and Do had no "past" here until
their vehicles first met in the early '70's.   Since they
were not <em>incarnate</em> until the early '70's, the past
histories for those vehicles have no relevance.  The same
holds true for any of their students.  We did not enter any
of these vehicles we are using until we met up with our
Teachers.  I hope you will study our information enough so
that it can offer you the opportunity to realize some of
these points.<p>
<p>
As far as anything Ti and Do have been criticized for since
or during their awakening, the facts of those incidents have
never been hidden from us, their students.  They have even
been addressed in some of the materials in this book.
However, the facts of those incidents <em>have</em> been
hidden from the public and distorted to bolster the opinions
of Ti and Do's critics and to sell more newspapers.  The
media also likes to present the viewpoints of drop-outs from
non-mainstream groups such as ours as being absolutely
accurate without considering the possibility that they might
be biased in their opinions, defending their position of
"quitting" or being "asked to leave."  Once an individual
leaves the group, they have to find fault with the group in
order to justify their decision of ceasing the discipline.
I know that the actions of my Older Members have always been
honorable and with no ill-intent, motivated only by their
desire to serve the Kingdom of Heaven.<p>
<p>
To us, one of the worst traits people of this day and age
have acquired is to think they can judge others and base
those judgments upon some past event.  Almost daily, someone
is being branded by the media for some incident that
occurred years ago that is not characteristic of that
individual's current life.  This practice presumes that that
person has not changed.  Can anyone honestly say that they
never did anything they now regret and would not do again?
Why not give others credit for doing the same?  Learning
from our mistakes is the primary road to growth and
improvement, and the suffering that is experienced in the
process can build strength and character.  If our Creator is
forgiving and does not hold individuals to their past
mistakes, would it make sense that humans would be above
doing the same?
<p>
Some could think that all of us in the class share the same
form of psychosis with our Teachers.  Even if that were so,
I would gladly live this life of "delusion" over the
insanity of living your "reality" full of ugliness, despair,
and fruitlessness.  Yet I know that what Ti and Do have
taught us is the <em>only</em> reality.  If we are so crazy,
why have the vast majority of those who have known us
personally regarded us as being some of the most capable,
reliable, happy, and productive people they have ever known?
Why is it that so many of those who dropped out of the class
desired so desperately to return?  It could only be because
the discipline and ways Ti and Do have taught us work.
Quite a few class members have held very professional and
responsible positions in the human world to help support our
classroom's needs.  Our employers and co-workers soon
recognized there was something very "special" about us
(their words) and felt we were their most valued employees.
Thanks to our having been taught Next Level ways, we always
strove to do our best, welcomed criticism as an opportunity
to improve ourselves, did not respond defensively but were
quick to take responsibility for and correct any of our
mistakes, and did not respond in anger to others.  We liked
to stay busy and productive and did not stoop to participate
in office gossip or waste time by chattering with others.
People were unconsciously drawn to us because of the
presence of Ti and Do's mind within us, though we chose not
to share what we knew with them as we knew that in most
cases such high-level information would only short-circuit
their human brains and be unproductive to them.<p>
<p>
If you really knew the Bible, you would recognize Ti and Do
for who they are.  The requirements for entry into the Next
Level taught by Ti and Do are <em>exactly</em> the same as
those taught by every other Representative whose task was to
bring the formula for exit from the human kingdom.  But
those very requirements threaten the current human status
quo.  It is the unconscious recognition that our Older
Members speak the truth, the facts, that threatens so many
and causes them to respond with immediate hatred toward our
Teachers.  The price of entry is much dearer than the masses
are willing to pay.  They are instead quick to accept the
counterfeit versions given to them, such as "He did it all
for you," that are designed to bind them to the human
kingdom and thereby ensure the death of their souls.
Everyone seems to overlook that the foremost requirement
given since the dawn of this civilization is to love the
Ones who created and nurtured us with <em>all</em> our
hearts, <em>all</em> our souls, and <em>all</em> our minds.
At this time, when a Rep is <em>here</em>, the question is
how can you give some of your love to a spouse or child and
say <em>all</em> of your love is for God?  To be preoccupied
with family values and procreation is to take mistresses and
cheat on Him.  The fact that no one with even the smallest
amount of God's mind in them would feel comfortable engaging
in a mammalian act of sensuality while in His physical
presence proves that in the core of their being they know it
is a shameful and degrading act rather than an expression of
their love for Him or His love for us.<p>
<p>
There is so much I want to say and express about how I feel
about my Older Members, Ti and Do.  The human words seem so
inadequate compared to what is in my heart.  I thank the
Next Level every day that I was allowed to be a part of this
classroom experience and to know and observe Ti and Do - to
be instructed by them, corrected by them, and feel the Next
Level's compassion and support expressed through them.  I
have never known anyone who could even come close to being
as wise, keen, kind, dignified, fair, patient, humble, or
genuine as they have always been.  I remain daily in awe of
them.  If you cannot also see these qualities in them, it is
only because the Evolutionary Level Above Human has not seen
fit to give you the ears to hear and the eyes to see Two of
Their own.  The proof of Who They are will be that we, and
all those who align themselves with the true Kingdom of
Heaven, in whatever manner they translate their recognition
of that Kingdom, will be "saved" for continued advancement
or nourishment, while all those who condemn Ti and Do or
this information will themselves be condemned by the Next
Level.  It is our understanding that all those who judge
this information negatively and thereby align themselves
with the opposition will be "recycled" when the Next Level
terminates this temporal, impermanent (if not holographic)
existence, which we expect will happen soon after our
departure.  Whether or not you depart with us may not mean
much to you - but it should.  To overcome the human
condition and be born into the Evolutionary Level Above
Human, under the midwifing care of Their Representatives, is
what you were created for.  It is the only reason for your
existence.<p>
<p>
As we step aboard a Next Level mothership marveling at the
wonders around us, my hope is that all the members of the
Heavenly Kingdom, from the Oldest to the youngest, will join
us in a standing ovation for two very special Older Members,
Ti and Do.<p>
