<h2><em>1988</em></h2>
<font size="+6">T</font>he <em><strong>'88 Update</strong></em> was written while we were in seclusion
during the first "snatching away" and was made public to a minor degree
through a mailing to various New Age Centers, Health Food Stores, writers,
preachers, ufologists, monasteries, and so on.  Beginning in approximately
late 1986 and continuing throughout this time period, some extremely
revealing information was surfacing worldwide.  Reports of government
cover-ups of UFO crashes, alien technology being acquired and tested by
the military, and rumors of underground bases housing joint
alien/government projects circulated widely.  In addition, detailed
reports of abductions of humans by space aliens for the purposes of
genetic experimentation and hybridization were escalating.  It was a
particularly accelerated time in our own awakening as well.  Missing
pieces of the puzzle were being given to us that broadened our overview
and helped to clarify some aspects of our own mission.  We have no doubt
that the timing of these exposures was deliberate and calculated, not only
for our own sake but in preparing the world for events yet to come.
