Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 3
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr>

Welcome to our third session in our series, 
<em>Beyond Human <strong>--</strong> The
Last Call</em>. If you watched Session 1, you remember that
we thought that it was going to be a question and answer session
with helpers, and it ended up being mainly listening to Do talk
and we didn't get to questions. Then, when we realized that Session
1, after watching it, had ended up with so many gaps or big open
spaces in our big picture, we decided to try in Session 2 to specifically
address the helpers that are here with me to pinpoint and focus
in on the obvious holes or gaps in the big picture by asking questions.
Today we want to welcome these students. They are going to serve
in that capacity. Why don't we just get started by giving us
the first question that we put on our list.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Ok. Would you like to discuss the difference between
the soul and the mind and the vehicle?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Ok, that's a big one. I don't know where we'll get, if we'll
get past that one. The soul, the mind, the vehicle. Even though
we've discussed it a little bit before, we use the reference to
this body that we're wearing - this flesh and bones - we use the
term "vehicle" because it helps us separate from the
body. So, <strong>vehicle</strong>, or sometimes historically in religious
literature it is referred to as a "vessel." Whether
it's a "vehicle" or "vessel," the term helps
to get out of identifying with it. Where we get into trouble
is when we identify and call this "me," because this
is certainly <em>not</em> me if the soul has awakened. This is
just a suit of clothes that I'm wearing, and at times it can be
an encumbrance for me. It can be something that I don't want
to identify with. It has its own desires. It's kind of like
a living computer that doesn't ever quite shut down. Even when
it's in a sleep state, it doesn't quite shut down. And it has
desires that manifest in ways of wanting certain foods, or wanting
certain experiences, or wanting to indulge in certain habits that
it had been subjected to. It wants to do repeat performances
in those habits, whether it's food or going places or seeing things
or attachments or addictions. So, we'll use the term "vehicle"
when we speak of the body that we're wearing.
<p>
Now, the <strong>soul</strong>. What is the soul? That's a good one.
The description that we've been given to picture or illustrate
the soul in trying to understand its relationship to the vehicle
is to think of the soul as a "pillowcase" or a "container,"
even though it's an invisible container. It's a container that
encompasses the space that the body takes up. Sometimes we feel
that it encompasses even a little outside the space that the vehicle
has. It's like a pillowcase or a container for the mind. So,
if we're talking about vehicle, soul, and mind, then the flesh
body is just a suit of clothes - a vehicle. The real "me"
is the identity that I have awakened to that I know goes on, because
I know that this vehicle is perishable, it can fall apart, it
can die, it can return to dust, it can get completely put out
of commission on the freeway. But "I" am something
that does not die on the freeway. I am something that goes on.
I am something that has more existence, even if the extent of
your understanding of that is to think that, after the vehicle
dies, the soul goes to Heaven. We'll discuss where it goes, depending
on where you think it's going to go.
<p>
But here we're talking about identity or definition of terms.
This is not me. This is my suit of clothes or this is my vehicle.
I am the soul. Now, what is <em>in</em> the soul, or what occupies
the soul is <strong>mind</strong>. My mind? No, not <em>my</em> mind. I
don't have any mind. So, what am I? Well, I'm the little switch
inside that pillowcase, or that container, that chooses what goes
in it. What goes in the soul, what mindstuff goes in the soul?
If you go to the originator, as far as I'm concerned, or you're
concerned, or these students are concerned, or anybody that's
listening to us is concerned, there are only two sources - originators
- of the mind that is available to us<strong>:</strong> the mind of the opposition
(Satan) and his world, or the <em>Truth,</em> which comes from the
Creator, the Kingdom of Heaven. Now, this is not truth in a philosophical
sense, not truth in a religious sense, it's Truth in <strong>truth</strong>
sense, as far as what really <em>is</em> - the accurate information,
as far as you can understand. Of course, "accurate"
changes as you learn more. Something becomes outdated as soon
as you get some new information. As close as we can get to the
Truth, the real Truth only comes from the source of the Creator,
the Kingdom of Heaven.
<p>
 Don't forget, we've talked about the member of that Kingdom of
Heaven who was a soul, an advanced soul, in the Kingdom of Heaven.
He separated from his Older Member, or from his Heavenly Father,
went his own way, and formed his own "corporation."
He had his own followers. He didn't like the definition of terms.
He had a new truth. He was a counterfeit. Now, this gets into
kind of a funny idea that some literature seems to suggest, that
he is a "copycat" of Jesus. He is the <em>counterfeit</em>
of Jesus. He's always trying to imitate Jesus. We certainly
can't go wrong by looking at it from that point of view. I don't
know if that in actuality occurred, but it certainly has been
occurring ever since there was a Jesus, and, I would imagine,
even before someone appeared on the scene 2000 years ago that
was identified as Jesus. Before we had that identity of Jesus,
Satan, or Lucifer, did identify as a separateness, a different
kind of thinking, a different definition of terms - therefore,
a mind other than the Creator's mind.
<p>
So remember, we've discussed how Satan, or Lucifer, and his camp
are aggressors. They're not shy. They don't wait to be asked.
They fill your head with ideas all the time and you think that
<em>you're</em> having them, that these are <em>your</em> thoughts.
The only thing that you can really identify with as "you"
is when you question yourself as, "What am I looking for"?
That's getting into the department of options or choices, which
I know on our list of questions here is going to throw things
off, because I'm suddenly getting into what is "free will."
<p>
People talk about "free will" as a doctrine or a concept.
Free will is something that I have that I cannot get rid of.
It is mine forever. As long as I exist, I have free will. Now
believe it or not, Luci sees the Kingdom of Heaven as interfering
with your free will. The opposite of that is true. The Kingdom
of Heaven, even though it does try to get your mind off of yourself
and bring you into the mind, the understanding, the knowledge
that is in the Kingdom of Heaven, our Heavenly Father's Kingdom
tries to liberate you from the misunderstanding, the wrong definition
of terms, the wrong concepts, and bring you to the Truth - tries
to liberate you from things that have held you in ignorance.
<p>
If there's one sin that Luci participates in - and all of his
followers - more than anything else, it's misinformation, it's
wrong usage of terms. Getting your eyes focused on, oh-oh, I
was about to say, "the wrong god." Because Luci doesn't
hesitate, he's not afraid of being blasphemous. He's not afraid
to sell you a concept of god. He's not afraid of selling you
a concept of Jesus that is completely off base.
<p>
Okay, we'll go back and review just for a moment. Vehicle
- flesh body - nothing but a suit of clothes. Even though it does
have expressions of desires and lusts and things that "I"
have to completely ignore. I don't even listen to those thoughts.
One of my tasks in overcoming is overcoming listening to any
voices or any impulses that this body would give to me. In the
early stages of that overcoming, I might hear that impulse, might
hear it two or three times. I might even give in to it, and then
be sorry that I gave in to it. So, I say, "Next time I'm
not going to give in to it." The next time I hear the impulse
of the body as it was asking for something that I had been told
or been taught was inappropriate for me to participate in, I am
a little bit more restrictive as to what I let the body get away
with the second time. Eventually, if I'm getting control and
I'm learning my lessons, because the way the Kingdom of Heaven
helps us in our lessons is to continue to send us - the negative?
Yes, it continues to send us the negative in order to give us
- what do we have that's ours that we can't get rid of? - option,
free will. The choice to accept the negative, listen to it, or
get rid of it, control it, eliminate it. Now, that's a lot of
steps of growth from first hearing it express itself and giving
into it some and then regretting it. And so, when you regret
it, then you go back and say, "Oh I'm sorry that I gave into
it, can I start afresh"? - which is the same thing as saying,
"Can I be forgiven? I want to conquer this thing, I don't
want to just be victimized by the desires of this flesh or this
body." Now, this is separate from the imposing mind of Luci
or someone in the invisible who is assigned by Luci to get me
off the path. And there is someone assigned by Satan, his camp,
to get me back into their "corporation," into their
philosophy, into their way of life, because the whole setup, the
whole structure of this planet in this Age has become the way
of thinking, the activities, the definition of terms of Satan's
camp. That is what it has become. Didn't have to become that.
It <strong><em>has</em></strong> become that. That's a condition. Our Heavenly
Father has permitted it to become that because He gives us the
knowledge of how to see it as that, how to work against it, how
to even overcome it, how to rise above it. 
<p>
In a sense, our Heavenly Father permits Luci to send someone
to stay close to us, to keep an eye on us, to hammer on our heads,
to even use the vehicle to send us impulses that we don't want
to give into. In other words, to constantly challenge us, the
free will, the choice maker, the one who can opt. Don't forget,
we've got this awkwardness here. Here's this mind assigned by
Luci's camp here, and this flesh here, imposing ideas on us that
we didn't ask for. They just impose them on us. And then in
order to engage the help we have from the Next Level, or our Heavenly
Father's Kingdom, we have to engage <em>asking</em> for help. We
have to acknowledge to our Heavenly Father's Kingdom and whatever
help He has given to us that, "I listened to this impulse
of the vehicle," or "I listened to that influence give
me these thoughts, and Oh! They aren't your thoughts. I didn't
get them from you. Help me not <em>do</em> that"! And so,
when you ask for help, you get help, from your Teacher saying,
"Well, I thought I had gone over that with you. I'll go
over it with you better, and maybe give you more ammunition in
warding off the imposition of those uninvited thoughts that encourage
you into activity that is not from the Kingdom of Heaven."
<p>
Well, that's it in a nutshell as far as separating the flesh,
or the vehicle, from the soul, that invisible pillowcase or container
for mindstuff, realizing that mindstuff really comes from only
two sources. But if you say, for example, if this whole corporation
has many, many people working in it, and they work on many, many,
many projects, then there are going to be a lot of different thoughts
at different levels that come in that are from our Father's Kingdom,
and therefore, that mindstuff is from our Father's Kingdom. Don't
forget, <em>that</em> mindstuff comes only on the basis of our asking,
our pursuing it, our desiring it. All this <em>other</em> mindstuff
- from this great big "corporation," that's a giant "corporation,"
has many, many, many members working in it - is in opposition to
our Father's Kingdom. One source (Lucifer) is the aggressor,
and is constantly laying on humans what he considers the truth
to be. The other source is the Creator, the One that created
Truth, even the Truth itself, even the understanding, even the
<strong>concept</strong>, but doesn't force it on humans. All right, do
you see the conflict? That's what we're up against.
<p>
Another thing we had to take into account here is, the stronger
I get, the better I get at my little choices. By learning this
procedure of working against the negative, asking for help, and
receiving it from the positive, or from our Heavenly Father's
Kingdom, each time I go a step further and become more putty in
the hands of this Kingdom. Because I'm trying to become a part
of that Household, I have to get rid of individuality in the things
that separate me from it, which Lucifer's camp considers to be
good things - individuality and separateness and "do your
own thing." Each time I get a little further, or a little
closer to my Heavenly Father's Kingdom, what happens? Luci's
"corporation" fires the guy that I overcame and sends
a stronger one, a better one with more tricks up his sleeve than
the one I previously had. And our Father's Kingdom says, "Don't
worry. Don't worry. I even <em>created</em> those guys. I even
created the options that they could take in going awry. <strong>I
am the only Creator.</strong> So, for each right word or right definition
of term, I also created a number of wrong definitions of terms
that shouldn't have been used, but were there as options."
<p>
Wow! That gets into a big picture. How could that Creator have
created everything that was good and created everything that was
evil? No! Did not create one iota that was evil. But did create
complete <em>potential</em> for evil, in order that we still have
the capacity to maintain the one thing that He did give to us,
that <em>is</em> us, that we can't even get rid of - free will, the
choice of what direction we go.
<p>
Okay, what do you have on your list? Let's take our next question.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I was wondering if you'd want to explain the difference
in the terms Life and Death.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, that's an appropriate next question. Boy! Does that
really fit with what we've just been talking about. Luci has
this Age, this world, this society out there, as far as I know
on every hemisphere, believing
that death is the death of the vehicle - the death of the
body. And that life is coming in at birth through a birth canal
- that that is life and losing this is death. That didn't come
from our Father's Kingdom. That's one of Luci's definitions.
Study your Bible if you want to learn
the proper usage of those words, and you'll very quickly learn
the way our Father's Kingdom defined "death," in relating
to humans, even in the Old Testament and even in the New Testament.
Well, it's easier to describe death by saying that if someone
expresses something that is not true, and has "bought into"
the camp of misinformation, that individual is in a dead condition
by the standard of our Father's Kingdom. That individual gets
life once he goes out of Luci's camp and comes into this one.
Or the reverse<strong>:</strong> if he's in this camp and he goes into Luci's,
he becomes among the dead. If he comes in contact with someone
from our Father's Kingdom, he recognizes that this is the Truth
and he starts to go with it, then he has begun to taste of Life.
Therefore, Truth and Life are synonymous, as far as terminology
usage in our Father's Kingdom is concerned. So, death and misinformation
are synonymous.
<p>
Let's go back to the previous question we were talking
about. What's in this soul or this "pillowcase" for
mindstuff? It's never all from our Father's Kingdom. It's never
all from the misinformation camp, or from Satan's world. It's
a composite. It's percentages. If I have enough of our Father's
Kingdom's mind in there that I can begin to utilize it a little
bit and it begins to shine through a little bit, then I'm not
totally dead. And if I continue to engage it, then I begin to
come more into Truth, more into Life, even though I've got a heavy
percentage of misinformation still in there. You don't get knowledge
from the Kingdom of Heaven by "Oh, I'm going to give you
this beautiful thought, and this is knowledge." You get
knowledge, you get lessons, you get information mainly by hard
knocks. And the more you ask for knowledge, the more you ask for
lessons, the more you ask for situations that will bring the Truth
to you, the more you ask for every one of those, you're thrust
into a situation and a circumstance where you're tested and, uh
oh, <strong>you're</strong> tested. What am "I"? "I'm"
the one who has free will. "I'm" the one that can take
that situation and say, "Oh, this is horrible! What has
happened to me? I'm set back. My world has crumbled." 
Or I can say, "Goodness, I didn't ask for this. This happened
to me in spite of my not wanting it to happen to me. So, where's
the positive in it"? And so I turn and I ask my Heavenly
Father, or the closest contact I have, whatever I can use as my
point of reference to the Kingdom of Heaven, knowing that I can
easily speak to the Kingdom of Heaven and be addressing the wrong
crowd, because they present themselves as the Kingdom of Heaven.
But if I'm asking for Truth, if I'm asking for anything and everything
that separates me from the Most High God, from the Creator, then
I begin to get another lesson. I get another confrontation, I
get another experience that jolts me, that would at first, initially,
affect me adversely. And these guys over here in Lucifer's camp
are going to say, "Ah ha! See, I told you what would happen
to you if you stay on that path." They would have it seem
to me that it was a negative. And yet if I say, "I am sure
this wouldn't be happening to me if it wasn't good. I can find
the good in it if I ask." That's true, it always works.
That little saying...where did that saying come from, "All
things work together for good to those who love the Lord"?
Might as well put "True Lord" in that, because then
it would certainly work. What was your question again?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, if you could explain the difference
in the terms Life and Death.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay. I think we should go a little further
with that. Life and Death. I can't say strongly enough that
death of the vehicle, death of the body, or losing the body, losing
the vehicle, essentially has no long-term effect on "me."
It <em>can</em> put me out of a classroom circumstance for a period
of time. Now, this gets into a discussion of, when I'm out of
body, if I'm connected with our Heavenly Father's Kingdom, there
are a number of choices that our Heavenly Father's Kingdom can make. 
He reads me out in His computer, and he looks on His meter and
he says, "That soul's worth saving. It just got kicked out
of that vehicle in that accident on the freeway. It certainly
isn't just waste. It certainly still has some goodness in it.
So, we're going to put it aside over here, or we're going to
'put it on ice,' so to speak, or we're going to save it in some
condition."
<p>
In other words, our Heavenly Father's Kingdom can
actually take that soul, set it aside, and wait until they feel
it is the appropriate time to put it back into the Earth condition,
into the classroom condition, into the human kingdom. Think of
the human kingdom as a stepping stone on your way into our Heavenly
Father's Kingdom, if you make the right pursuits. Because you
can also go through that human kingdom and, with the wrong pursuits,
get out of that kingdom and be in an advanced human kingdom that's
outside the Age of the Earthly environment you knew and can be
seen as "heaven," and other humans may see you as a
heavenly creature with heavenly skills and heavenly capacities,
but it won't be our Father's Kingdom. And you could move into
a camp that will easily take the responsibility of creating religions
and all of that. They also will give you concepts of life extension.
Now, there's a big difference in what this other camp calls "life"
- the reason this terminology of "death" and "life"
got all messed up in the beginning.
<p>
In our Father's Kingdom, when you really get to
be a full-fledged or "badge-wearing" member in our Father's
Kingdom - not in the human kingdom, but having graduated from
the human kingdom - and you are in our Father's Kingdom, you
take on a suit of clothes. You take on a vehicle that is imperishable
and incorruptible. As long as it is sustained in an advanced,
incorruptible, imperishable environment, it cannot be destroyed.
You have eternal life. Not only does the soul have life, but
you can wear a vehicle that, for all intents and purposes, doesn't
need to decay. It doesn't have any age, it doesn't come from
a baby, it doesn't get old and need to be changed out for another
one. There's no loss of consciousness. It doesn't mean that
it can't be hurt and discarded. In certain circumstances it can
be injured, it can be hurt, it can be lost. And you can go to
"wardrobe" and pick up another one. And there you have
a new set of clothes - to the best of our understanding, you
would never again experience loss of consciousness because all
that is "you" is that soul in there which still has
control of free will, that can make choices, that can recognize
"mindstuff" as it comes from our Father's Kingdom, and
is trying more and more to eliminate the "mindstuff"
that comes from Luci's corporation, his misinformation camp. 
So, the human body dying, or losing the body, is not true death
any more than when a tulip plant, as a perennial, comes above
the surface, and the freeze comes, does that plant die? No. 
Only what showed died. But what still remained was, in a sense,
the genetic package of the soul, the continued existence, or the
further opportunity for the soul to take a shell in order to learn
lessons.
<p>
Souls and spirits in a discarnate condition cannot
learn lessons. That's the way our Heavenly Father has designed
it. They cannot learn lessons. Even Luci's camp knows there
are limitations to what a soul can learn in the discarnate condition.
What do we mean by "discarnate"?
We're speaking of a soul or a spirit outside of a vehicle. Whether
it's a vehicle in the human kingdom or a vehicle in the Kingdom
of Heaven. The discarnate can serve Luci's camp. He can be someone
that can be standing right here beside me at this moment from
Luci's camp, trying to interrupt my thinking, trying to get me
off track, trying to get me to stop asking questions as we talk
to my Father and to interfere with this task. And I'm sure there's
one standing here at this moment, even though I don't like to
acknowledge his presence. It interferes with me the moment I
even acknowledge his presence in order to have you understand
that in a discarnate condition lessons cannot really be learned.
You are confronted with addictions, ties, all the misconceptions
and their application only when you're in a physical body.
<p>
Now Luci's camp, they're pretty good at robbing
bodies. They're pretty good at even using bodies for what they
want to use them for and then discarding them. Even though <em>our</em>
Father's camp created them, they are His product, and He has the
right to destroy them if He wants to, in a flash. He is much
more restrained in how He would even permit any of His members
to use bodies. He cares for them more. He protects them more.
<p>
Luci's camp will influence you to do a task, and
not really get themselves that involved, try to get you to do
a task for them. And they're convinced that they are doing themselves
a big favor. They're also, in the process, avoiding putting themselves
in a lesson opportunity circumstance, because when they're doing
that they are out of body, or they're staying in their - this
gets kind of awkward here - in their advanced body form. It seems
strange, it's very confusing to realize that Luci and many, many
members in Luci's camp, can have what humans at this point in
an Age, can see as un-human vehicles. And you think<strong>:</strong> un-human?
Un-human? They're Heavenly vehicles? They're glorified bodies,
they're physical bodies of the Kingdom of Heaven?
<p>
Okay, at this point we have to go back and remember
that when Satan was booted out of the Household of our Father's
Corporation, he had a "heavenly body" in the making.
According to the record, he took a third of the heavens with
him, must have been a bunch of people, and they had "heavenly
bodies" in the making. They also had a lot of technical,
advanced information, beyond human technology. They knew how
to get from here to there in different means, certainly, than
humans in this Age would know. Some knew how to appear and disappear.
They had a body that had all kinds of capacity that human flesh
on this planet, in this Age, do not have. Don't be confused,
they are not "Heavenly bodies." Heaven is where our
Father is. They were cast out of where our Father is. The moment
they were cast out, they no longer had Heavenly bodies, they had
what was left of a partially completed heavenly body - a hybrid
similar to what would happen if a caterpillar were removed from
the chrysalis before it became a butterfly. What do I mean by
"what was left"? Once they were cast out of where our
Father's camp is, they began to be in a condition of perishable
and.... What's the other term?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Corruptible?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Corruptible. That's right. The most normal
conditions for them are corruptible and perishable. Their bodies
become perishable, which is the only thing they're concerned with.
They're not concerned with "corruptible" because they're
on a different path of "real knowledge." Once they
became perishable, they even know it. If you read the records
supposedly of people who've had encounters with space aliens,
whether it's Adamski's camp, or we could sit and talk about that
kind of stuff for some time, about so-called encounters of the
third kind or the fourth kind, where they got information from
certain space aliens that would say, "It isn't exactly like
you're told in your Bible. We do lose our bodies, but we live
a lot longer than your bodies. They might last several hundred
years or they might have an extension quite a bit longer than
yours." Therefore, the person who's hearing all that thinks
that he's listening to members of the Kingdom of Heaven, that
he's coming to the reality of what the Kingdom of Heaven really
is, and he's shocked by it. He thinks, "Wow, all those religious
ideas I had were off base," not realizing that the camp he's
talking to created those off-base religious ideas, and even now
is selling you, or selling that individual who's having that experience,
on "I am from the Kingdom of Heaven. We did create those
religions on your planet. We are trying to help you move up the
ladder so that you could serve in our kingdom, and help us in
our pursuit of 'universal mind,' 'cosmic consciousness,' becoming
'gods'."
<p>
Okay, wow! there are some identifying features of
those vehicles that they wear, not all of them, but some of them.
Some of those vehicles they wear still have gender, still have
age. Don't forget, Luci and his camp retained a lot of their
intelligence, a lot of their skill capacity, a lot of their technical
proficiency. They know how to make spacecrafts. I'm sure, measured
by our Father's Kingdom, their spacecrafts are pitiful in comparison,
because even at the point that Luci and his crowd left, they knew
a little bit more than the model T, in comparison, as far as spacecrafts
are concerned. But they do know spacecrafts. They do know how
to travel in space. They do know how to move into parts of the
heavens that certainly humans on this planet still find closed
to them as they try to get out of here a little bit - go to
the moon, and then into this orbit and that one. We're just <em>barely</em>
beginners - or the humans here are. Of course, they're really
getting into a world that doesn't belong to them. And Luci and
his camp are circulating in a world that does not belong to them.
But they can't get into our Father's community<strong>;</strong> that is still
held separate.
<p>
Most of them will either appear to be male or female
in some quality. Even though they might be losing some of their
"maleness" or their "femaleness," frequently
not of their own choice, but because when in outer space and you're
outside of the vibration of a planet that has the kind of fertilizer
and the ingredients that are primary to this garden, to this planet,
they can lose their capacity to reproduce. Not that they would
want to, but in spite of their desires. So, they have to come
and rob vehicles. They have to do artificial insemination. They
have to do genetic experimentation. Now, as I said before, how
much of this they do on this garden, to what extent, and to what
extent the reports that we've heard are true, I do not know the
particulars. It has not been given me to know them. And I feel,
in a sense, it's our protection that we don't know them. But
I do know that in our Father's Kingdom, in a sense, everyone is
the same age. I'm talking about the vehicle they wear. Because
as long as they stay in that protected environment, and do work
in His Kingdom, there is no aging. It's as if the vehicles are
all the same age. They are indestructible, imperishable, and
they can't be led off track. They can't be corrupted as long
as they stay in our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
Now, if you stay in this world that we would still
call part of the heavens, it still has many members in it that
are not of our Father's Kingdom. And their vehicles then have
to be concerned with age and protection, because they don't have
good enough control, even though they're working on it very hard,
that would allow them to just go to "wardrobe" and pick
up another vehicle. They're constantly, or frequently, trying
to master the techniques of developing "wardrobe," of
developing vehicles. And here again, they're trying to copy our
Father's Kingdom so that you wouldn't know the difference. Because
in our Father's Kingdom there might be a number of different types
of "wardrobe" or "suits of clothes" that souls
could wear. There might be little ones, and there might be middle-sized
ones, and big ones. And they might have different shapes, and
different colored skin, and certain different things. I'm sure
that our Father's Kingdom, if our Father's Kingdom wants to use
them, could certainly create what we would call robots in order
to put certain things in certain areas if he didn't want to take
a chance on losing a soul. So, it's just an extended device,
it's a technical advancement.
<p>
Lucifer has his robots. He has his counterfeits.
He has his copy of the things that are in our Father's Kingdom,
but they're always lousy. If they really got under the microscope
by those who were in the know, they would know they (the copies)
couldn't cut it. They'd throw you in jail because they're counterfeit.
Okay, it's because they <em>do not have</em> life eternal. They
do not have incorruption. Now, this gets me into another topic
that's on our list of questions. Incorruption. Well, let's go
to our next question.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, would you like to talk now about the
term "resurrection" and how it has changed?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay. "Resurrection" has a little
different connotation than "Life" or "Death."
Resurrection is more like a condition that you could apply to
a soul when it enters a vehicle and comes in to <strong>life</strong>. 
Now in order to come in, if a soul is entering a vehicle and it's
coming into <strong>life</strong>, then it means that it must have advanced
pretty far in getting rid of misinformation and bringing in <em>real</em>
information. Because, don't forget, Life and Truth are synonymous.
So, if it's bringing in <em>real</em> information, it's an advanced
soul. It's one that has had a lot of teaching from our Father's
Kingdom and has made that choice. It, in a sense, is very close
to overcoming.
<p>
A couple of illustrations that we might think of
- let's take the Bible, in the book of Revelation. It talks of
a first resurrection and a second resurrection at the close of
the Age. If a group of souls comes in and they are advanced souls,
they are from our Father's Kingdom, they are <em>alive.</em> Now,
being from our Father's Kingdom meant that they once had to graduate
<em>into</em> that Kingdom, or they're being protected in that Kingdom
because they still have a few little major touchups to be done
so they'd be a good match to a vehicle of that Kingdom, so that
they wouldn't still have desires that could not be fulfilled by
that wardrobe or that vehicle that they would get in our Father's
Kingdom. If a mind that is that advanced in the ways of our Father's
Kingdom comes and takes a flesh body in the human kingdom, then
it has brought that body into life. It is suddenly living. It
has <em>resurrected</em>. It has taken a <em>dead, worthless plant</em>
and turned it into the epitome of life. From a human's point
of view - not from the point of view of our Father's Kingdom, but
from a <em>human's</em> point of view - it is the most alive thing
around. It possesses the most <em>Truth</em> (the facts) that can
be had.
<p>
Now, I'm afraid that here I need to get a little
personal, because in the same sense that as we speak to you out
there, those who are listening to these sessions, I might be mistaken,
but the information that has been given to me suggests that <em>you</em>
are going to be a part of what the book of Revelation calls the
"Second Resurrection." In other words, in order for
you to <em>identify</em> with the knowledge that is coming through
us as we give it to you and for you to recognize it as from our
Father's Kingdom, in order for you to recognize that knowledge
means you have to have a lot of that knowledge already, even though
it might have been pretty well in a dormant condition. A lot
of that mind has to be in you or slightly outside of your vehicle
craving to get in and wanting to take that vehicle. In a sense,
if you do have some of that information, then you were once given
a gift of migrating to where that information was. You received
a lot of that information and you applied a lot of that information.
At a given time when you lost a vehicle, the Next Level took
your soul and put it aside carefully and protected it for the
end of the Age and said, "Now you can go back and finish
up those little areas that you didn't have that much control in,
because," (Whoops! Here we get to another touchy point)
"because we're sending other Representatives from the Kingdom
of Heaven who can <em>help</em> you with the task of finishing up
your overcoming, getting <em>Luci</em> out of the way, developing
<em>muscle</em> in <em>not listening</em> to him, learning the difference
between the Truth that can be gained through <em>asking</em> from
the <em>untruth</em> or the misinformation that is fed to us <em>without</em>
asking." The untruth always gets us back into the world,
back into ties, back into addictions. Luci's camp <em>counts</em>
on keeping you "drunk" by having you addicted to the
world - addicted even in concepts, addicted in misinformation,
not to say the least, addicted to the wrong kinds of things to
put in your vehicle, whether it be drugs, or booze, or overconsuming,
or wrong kinds of patterns.
<p>
Of course, we get into an element here that's also
very, very touchy ground that we've all been through, but we have
to eventually face that it is the worst drug of all. And that
was the drug of <em>when we chose</em> - and when I speak of "we"
here, I speak as representatives of the offspring, the family
tree, of Adam and Eve - that when they fell and they took on the
responsibility of reproductive activity, then of course, all the
spirits that came into those vehicles down that chain of offspring
also participated in that misinformation, saying, "Oh, God
gave me this capacity to reproduce." Now, what I'm getting
at, the worst addiction that exists is...love? Oh oh, I thought
God was love. <em>Luci</em> uses that term. He even would have
you believe that sex is love. I'm sorry. That one's a <strong>lie</strong>.
Ultimately, even though we have all been hooked on that same
drug, we've all gone through that period, don't forget, we took
<em>advantage</em> of the hothouse. We took <em>advantage</em> of
the negative. We took <em>advantage</em> of the fact that we were
products of those who went astray. We learned from their lessons.
We've overcome them.
<p>
But still, sex is the strongest drug - there's not
a drug, there's not a morphine, or anything that is produced by
chemicals, or plants of this world as strong as that drug. That
drug requires that you even let one of Luci's technicians in that
department absolutely take control of your mind and have you possessed
with the fulfillment of that act. He knows that as long as you
participate in that drug your capacity for recognizing the Truth
(the facts) is just about as good as it is for someone who's had
a half a dozen martinis, and you say to them, "Are you clear-headed?
Can we really talk about significant information"? And
they say, (slurred voice) "I'm just as clear-headed as I ever am."
I don't mean that just while
in the act of that reproductive activity, I'm talking about as
long as even those reproductive hormones are active in your system,
as long as they're still cycling, you will be working against
the drunkenness of that drug. Now, I know that this could sound
just as far out as anything could sound, but <em>down in your heart,</em>
if you're from my Father's Kingdom, you know that Jesus was not
a sexual creature. His M.O. presented itself as one that Luci
would have you interpret wrongly. In other words, Luci would
have you think Jesus was pure, having never needed to overcome
anything. But regardless of how Luci would twist things, you
know that He was pure.
<p>
Let's take the term "virginity" as another
wrong application of terms. Luci says that a virgin is someone
that is pure. But he tacks on another addition to that definition.
He says<strong>:</strong> one who has never had sexual activity. Virginity
- pure in the physical - yes. Correct definition. But virginity
meaning someone who has not had sexual activity? No, wrong application,
wrong definition. Therefore, I can <em>recover</em> my virginity.
I can become a virgin. In a sense, someone who has never
- if you really think of the soul's existence - who has <em>never</em>
participated in it, they don't even know what there is to overcome
about it. Unfortunately, we can rest pretty assured that there's
no one in this Earth Age that has been lucky enough to not participate
in it, save, maybe a few isolated cases. I'm not saying that
our Father's Kingdom says, of necessity, you must stoop to participate
in that and overcome it, though it may be the case. It's safe
to say that there is a spectrum of addictions, indulged in because
of ignorance or misinformation, that a human cannot go through
a lifetime without falling prey to. The truth is that when you
are confronted with it - if you are confronted with it - and
then <em>confronted</em> with it, and <em>confronted</em> with it,
even lifetime after lifetime, and you refuse it, the amount of
effort it takes to not experiment is less effort than experimenting
and then withdrawing from it. It doesn't do any good to not participate
if you haven't learned the lessons. The same "muscle"
hasn't been developed against that drug that would be developed
had you given into it, participated in it, gotten totally addicted
to it, and then had to withdraw from that addiction with the help
of your asking to withdraw from or get out of that addiction.
So, unfortunately, here we had to face the issue of some real
no-no's.
<p>
Let's go back to "resurrection." <strong>Your</strong>
possible resurrection. As far as I can tell, what I have been
given says that if you can see the Kingdom of Heaven, if you can
see the Truth (reality) in what is coming through this vehicle,
it is not <em>of</em> this vehicle, it is not <em>me</em>, but it
has been <em>given</em> to me, and even says, "Now that it
has been given to you, it's yours." But any of us can abuse
it. Any of us can twist it - can take responsibility for it.
We can think, "Boy, look at what good ideas I came up with."
And the moment we think that way and don't give credit to the
source.... Don't forget, information comes from two sources
- from our Father's Kingdom or from misinformation. And when I
receive it, if I make the mistake of taking credit for it, I am
starting to separate at that point. As far as I can tell, the
information that has been given to me through Ti, through our
Father's Kingdom, says, "If you recognize this information,
<em>you</em> have been in the Kingdom of Heaven." Oh, wow!
That's a new thought. Yes, you have been in the Kingdom of Heaven.
If nothing more than "saved on ice" for this time,
you've been in the Kingdom of Heaven. And you have now come back
and, in a sense, you're standing outside of a vehicle, trying
to use that vehicle. You probably picked one with the help of
our Father's Kingdom. You probably picked a vehicle that might
be open to being accepting of this information, so that you can
then try to move into that vehicle.
<p>
Now, what does that mean? Does that mean you're
a "vehicle robber"? You're a "body snatcher"?
No, our Father's Kingdom assigned you that vehicle. They even
assigned you that vehicle, to a degree, at its inception, and
you've been checking on it from time to time, relating to it from
time to time, until this time - until you start to hear this
information. And at the time you start relating to it to this
degree, then it becomes your task to start to get into that vehicle.
<p>
I can remember so well that when Ti and I were first
working with our students, when we had taken them out of the world,
separate and in isolation, and we were getting down to the nitty
gritty, the information kept coming through our heads, and we
would say to them, "Get in your vehicle! Susie, get in your
vehicle! Johnny, get in your vehicle!" Because any time
we would hear something that we knew was not an example of the
knowledge of the Kingdom of Heaven, then they were not in their
vehicles. Someone else was speaking. So, our hope and our prayer
for your sake is that you will start getting into that vehicle.
You will start warding off all the bombardment that you will
begin to hear that says, "Boy, is this guy crazy. Is this
a cult if I ever heard of one"? Yes, it is a cult. I mean,
it's the cult of cults. It's the cult of <em>Truth</em>. And we
know what the world would like to do with it. We know that nothing
can happen to us. I have <em>nothing</em> to fear if I am a child
of my Heavenly Father. Nor do you. But are you going to be satisfied
with just being a child of your Heavenly Father, or are you going
to take advantage of an opportunity to <em>overcome the world</em>
with the help that Ti has sent you, so that you can enter His
Kingdom and not need to return? The only reason that He gave
us instruction to give you these sessions and these classrooms
was to offer <strong>you </strong>a <em>second resurrection</em>, a chance
to come in, finish your task, and enter His Kingdom.
<p>
And I see that we're down to 5 seconds.  We'll see you in our
next session.
