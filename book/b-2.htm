<center><strong> Breaking Away from the World (Discipleship)</strong></center> </font> <p><ul>
<li><strong>Matthew 10:34-39</strong> Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon 
the earth<strong>;</strong> I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.  For I have come to part asunder a man from his father, and a daughter from her mother, and a newly married wife from her mother-in-law - And a man's foes will be they of his own household. He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me<strong>;</strong> and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me<strong>;</strong> And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me, conforming wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying also] is not worthy of Me.  Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life on My account will find it.<p>

<li><strong>Matthew 19:29</strong> And anyone and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name's sake will receive many times more and will inherit eternal life.<p>

<LI><strong>Mark 3:33-35</strong> And He replied, Who are My mother and My
brothers?  And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him, He
said, See! Here are My mother and My brothers<strong>;</strong> For whoever does the things
God wills is My brother and sister and mother!  <p>

<LI><strong>Mark 12:30</strong> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength<strong>:</strong> this is the first commandment.  (King James)  <p>

<LI><strong>Mark 8:34-37</strong> And Jesus called the throng
with His disciples and said to them, If anyone intends to come after Me,
let him deny himself [forget, ignore, disown, and lose sight of himself
and his own interests] and take up his cross, and follow with Me.  For whoever wants to save his life, will lose it<strong>;</strong> and whoever gives up his life for My sake and the Gospel's will save it.  For what does it profit a man to
gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?  For what can a man give as an exchange (a compensation, a ransom, in return) for his life?  <p>

<LI><strong>Luke 9:23-25</strong> And He said to all, If any person wills
to come after Me let him deny himself and take up
his cross daily and follow Me [cleave steadfastly to Me, conform wholly to
My example in living and, if need be in dying also].  For whoever would
preserve his life <em>and</em> save it will lose <em>and</em> destroy it, but whoever loses
his life for My sake, he will preserve <em>and</em> save it.  <p>

<LI><strong>Luke 9:59-62</strong> And He said to another, Become My
disciple, side with My party, and accompany Me!  But he replied, <em>Lord</em>,
permit me first to go and bury (await the death of) my father.  But Jesus
said to him, Allow the dead to bury their own dead<strong>;</strong> but as for you, go <em>and</em>
publish abroad throughout all regions the kingdom of God.  Another also
said, I will follow You, Lord, <em>and</em> become Your disciple <em>and</em> side with Your
party<strong>;</strong> but let me first say good-bye to those at my home.  Jesus said to
him, No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.  <p>

<LI><strong>Luke 12:49-53</strong> I have come to cast fire upon the
earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!  I have a baptism with
which to be baptized, and how greatly and sorely I am urged on (impelled,
constrained) until it is accomplished!  Do you suppose that I have come to give peace upon earth?  No, I say to you, but rather division<strong>;</strong> For from now on in one house there
will be five divided, three against two and two against
three.  They will be divided, father against son and son against father,
mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against
her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  <p>

<LI><strong>Luke 14:26-27</strong> If anyone comes to Me and does not hate
his father and mother and his wife and children and brothers and sisters -
and even his own life also - he cannot be My disciple.  Whoever does not
persevere and carry his own cross and come after (follow) Me cannot be My
disciple.  <p>

<LI><strong>Luke 14:33</strong> So then, any of you who does not forsake
(renounce, surrender claim to, give up, say good-bye to) all that he has
cannot be My disciple.  <p>

<LI><strong>Luke 16:15</strong> But He said to them, You are the ones who
declare yourselves just <em>and</em> upright before men, but God knows your hearts.
For what is exalted <em>and</em> highly thought of among men is detestable <em>and</em>
abhorrent (an abomination) in the sight of God.  <p>

<LI><strong>John 12:25-26</strong> Anyone who loves his life loses it, but
anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.
[Whoever has no love for, no concern for, no regard for his life here on
earth, but despises it, preserves his life forever and ever.]  If anyone
serves Me, he must continue to follow Me [to cleave steadfastly to Me,
conform wholly to My example in living and, if need be, in dying] and
wherever I am, there will My servant be also.  If anyone serves Me, the
Father will honor him.  <p></ul>

<center><strong> Recognizing, Believing, & Following the Representative from
the Kingdom of Heaven</strong></center> </font> <p><ul>

<li><strong>Matthew 10:24-26</strong> A disciple is not above his teacher,
nor is a servant or slave above his master.  It is sufficient for the
disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant or slave like his master.
If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they speak evil of those of His Household.
So have no fear of them<strong>;</strong> for nothing is concealed that will not be
revealed, or kept secret that will not become known.<p>
  
<li><strong>Luke 16:13</strong> No servant is able to serve two masters<strong>;</strong>
for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stand by
<em>and</em> be devoted to the one and despise the other.  You cannot serve God and
mammon (riches, or anything in which you trust and on which you rely).<p>

<li><strong>John 5:19-20</strong> So Jesus answered them by saying, I
assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the Son is able to do nothing of
Himself (of His own accord)<strong>;</strong> but he is able to do only what He sees the
Father doing, for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the
same way.  The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to
(shows) Him everything that He Himself does.  And He will disclose to Him
(let Him see) greater things yet than these, so that you may marvel <em>and</em> be
full of wonder <em>and</em> astonishment.  <p>

<li><strong>John 6:39-40</strong> And this is the will of Him Who sent Me,
that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me, but that I should
give new life <em>and</em> raise [them all] up at the last day.  For this is My
Father's will <em>and</em> His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and believes
in and cleaves to <em>and</em> trusts in <em>and</em> relies on Him should have eternal
life, and I will raise him up at the last day.  <p>

<li><strong>John 6:44-47</strong> No one is able to come to Me unless the
Father Who sent Me attracts <em>and</em> draws him <em>and</em> gives him the desire to come
to Me, and I will raise him up at the last day.  It is
written in the Prophets, And they shall all be taught of God
[have Him in person for their Teacher].  Everyone who has listened to and
learned from the Father comes to Me.  Which does not imply that anyone has
seen the Father except He Who comes from God<strong>;</strong> He has seen the Father.  I
assure you, most solemnly I tell you, he who believes <em>in</em> Me [who adheres
to, trusts in, relies on, and has faith in Me] has (now possesses) eternal
life.  <p>

<li><strong>John 6:51</strong> I am this Living Bread that came down from
heaven.  If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever<strong>;</strong> and also the
Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh (body).  <p>

<li><strong>John 6:63</strong> It is the Spirit Who gives life [He is the
Life-giver]<strong>;</strong> the flesh conveys no benefit whatever.  The words (truths)
that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life.  <p>

<li><strong>John 6:65</strong> And He said, This is why I told you that no
one can come to Me unless it is granted him [unless he is enabled to do
so] by the Father.  <p>

<li><strong>John 7:28-29</strong> Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught
in the temple, Do you know Me, and do you know where I am from?  I have
not come on My own authority <em>and</em> of My own accord and as self-appointed,
but the One Who sent Me is true (real, genuine, steadfast)<strong>;</strong> and Him you do
not know!  I know Him because I come from His presence, and it was
He Who sent Me.  <p>

<li><strong>John 8:21-24</strong> Therefore He said again to them, I am
going away, and you will be looking for Me, and you will die in (under the
curse of) your sin.  Where I am going, it is not possible for you to come.
At this the Jews began to ask among themselves, Will He kill Himself?  Is
that why He says, Where I am going, it is not possible for you to come?
He said to them, You are from below<strong>;</strong> I am from above.  You are of this
world (of this earthly order)<strong>;</strong> I am not of this world.  That is why I told
you that you will die in your sins<strong>;</strong> for if you do not
believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.  <p>

<li><strong>John 8:31-47</strong> So Jesus said to those Jews who had
believed in Him, If you abide in My word [hold fast to My teachings and
live in accordance with them], you are truly My disciples.  And you will
know the Truth, and the Truth will set you free.  They answered Him, We
are Abraham's offspring (descendants) and have never been in bondage to
anybody.  What do You mean by saying, You will be set free?  Jesus
answered them, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, Whoever commits and
practices sin is the slave of sin.  Now a slave does not remain in a
household permanently (forever)<strong>;</strong> the son does remain
forever.  So if the Son liberates you, then you are
really and unquestionably free.  I know that you are Abraham's
offspring<strong>;</strong> yet you plan to kill Me, because My word has no entrance (makes
no progress, does not find any place) in you.  I tell the things which I
have seen <em>and</em> learned at My Father's side, and your actions also reflect
what you have heard <em>and</em> learned from your father.  They retorted, Abraham
is our father.  Jesus said, If you were Abraham's children, then
you would do the works of Abraham.
But now you are wanting <em>and</em> seeking to kill Me, a Man Who has told you the
truth which I heard from God.  This is not the way Abraham acted.  You are
doing the works of your father.  They said to Him, We are not
illegitimate children <em>and</em> born out of fornication<strong>;</strong> we have one Father,
even God.  Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me
<em>and</em> respect Me <em>and</em> welcome me gladly, for I proceeded (came forth) from
God.  I did not even come on My own authority
<em>or</em> of My own accord (as self-appointed)<strong>;</strong> but He sent me.  Why do you
misunderstand what I say?  It is because you are unable to hear what I am
saying.  You are of your father, the devil, and it is your will to
practice the lusts and gratify the desires of
your father.  He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in
the truth, because there is no truth in him.  When he speaks a falsehood,
he speaks what is natural to him, for he is a liar 
and the father of lies and of all that is false.  But because I speak the
truth you do not believe Me.  Who of you convicts Me of wrongdoing or finds Me guilty of sin?
Then if I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?  Whoever is of God listens to God.  This is the reason that
you do not listen<strong>:</strong>  because you do not belong to
God <em>and</em> are not of God <em>or</em> in harmony with Him.<p>

<li><strong>John 8:50-55</strong> However, I am not in search of honor for
Myself.  There is One Who seeks, and He
is the Judge.  I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, if anyone observes
My teaching, he will
by no means ever see and experience death.  The Jews said to Him, Now we
know that You are under the power of a demon (insane).  Abraham died, and
also the prophets, yet You say, If a man keeps My word, he will never
taste of death into all eternity.  Are You greater than our father
Abraham?  He died, and all the prophets died!  Who do You make Yourself
out to be?  Jesus answered, If I were to glorify Myself (magnify, praise,
and honor Myself), I would have no real glory, for My glory would be
nothing and worthless.  It is
My Father Who glorifies Me, of Whom you say that He is your God.  Yet you
do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him, but I
know Him.  If I should say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like
you.  But I know Him and keep His word.<p>

<li><strong>John 10:4-18</strong> When he has brought his own sheep
outside, he walks on before them, and the sheep follow him because they
know his voice.  They will never follow a stranger, but will run from him
because they do not know the voice of strangers <em>or</em> recognize their call.
Jesus used this parable (illustration) with them, but they did not
understand what He was talking about.  So Jesus said again, I assure you,
most solemnly I tell you, that I Myself am the Door for the sheep.  All
others who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep
did not listen to <em>and</em> obey them.  I am the Door<strong>;</strong> anyone who enters in
through Me will be saved (will live).  He will come in and he will go out
, and will find pasture.  The thief comes only in order to steal
and kill and destroy.  I came that they may have <em>and</em> enjoy life, and have
it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).  I am the Good Shepherd.
The Good Shepherd risks <em>and</em> lays down His life for the sheep.  But
the hired servant (he who merely serves for wages) who is neither the
shepherd nor the owner of the sheep, when he sees the wolf coming, deserts
the flock and runs away.  And the wolf chases <em>and</em> snatches them and
scatters [the flock].  Now the hireling flees because he merely serves for
wages and is not himself concerned about the sheep.  I am the Good
Shepherd<strong>;</strong> and I know <em>and</em> recognize My own, and My own know <em>and</em> recognize
Me - Even as the Father knows Me and I also know the Father - and I am giving
My life <em>and</em> laying it down on behalf of the sheep.  And I have other sheep
 that are not of this fold, I must bring <em>and</em> impel those
also<strong>;</strong> and they will listen to My voice <em>and</em> heed My call, and so there will
be one flock under one Shepherd.  For this [reason] the Father loves Me,
because I lay down My life - to take it back again.  No one takes it
away from Me.  On the contrary, I lay it down voluntarily.  I am
authorized <em>and</em> have power to lay it down (to resign it) and I am
authorized <em>and</em> have power to take it back again.  These are the
instructions (orders) which I have received from My Father.<p>

<li><strong>John 10:25-30</strong> Jesus answered them, I have told you
so, yet you do not believe Me.  The
very works that I do by the power of My Father and in My Father's name
bear witness concerning Me.  But you do not believe <em>and</em> trust <em>and</em> rely on Me because
you do not belong to My fold [you are no sheep of Mine].  The sheep that
are My own hear <em>and</em> are listening to My voice<strong>;</strong> and I know them, and they
follow Me.  And I give them eternal life, and they shall never lose it <em>or</em>
perish throughout the ages.  And no one is able to snatch them out of My
hand.  My Father, Who has given them to Me, is greater <em>and</em> mightier than
all<strong>;</strong> and no one is able to snatch [them] out of the Father's hand.
I and the Father are One. <p>

<li><strong>John 10:36-38</strong> Do you say of the One
Whom the Father consecrated <em>and</em> dedicated <em>and</em> set apart for Himself and
sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of
God?  If I am not doing the works of My Father,
then do not believe Me.
But if I do them, even though you do not believe Me <em>or</em> have faith in Me,
 believe the works <em>and</em> have faith in what I do, in order that
you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am
in the Father. <p>

<li><strong>John 12:44-50</strong> But Jesus loudly declared, The one who
believes in Me does not believe in <em>and</em> trust in <em>and</em> rely on Me, but
 in Him Who sent Me.  And whoever sees Me
sees Him Who sent Me.  I have come as a Light into the world, so that
whoever believes in Me may not continue to live in darkness.  If anyone hears My teachings and
fails to observe them, it is not
I who judges him.  For I have not come to judge <em>and</em> to condemn <em>and</em> to pass
sentence <em>and</em> to inflict penalty on the world, but to save the world.
Anyone who rejects Me <em>and</em> persistently sets Me at naught, refusing to
accept My teachings, has his judge<strong>;</strong> for the message that I have spoken
will itself judge <em>and</em> convict him at the last day.  This is because I have
never spoken on My own authority <em>or</em> of My own accord <em>or</em> as self-appointed,
but the Father Who sent Me has Himself given Me orders what
to say and what to tell.  And I know that His commandment is (means)
eternal life.  So whatever I speak, I am saying what My Father
has told Me to say and in accordance with His instructions. <p>

<li><strong>John 14:6</strong> Jesus said to him, I am the Way and the
Truth and the Life<strong>;</strong> no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me.<p>

<li><strong>John 15:1,4-6</strong> I am the True Vine, and My Father is
the Vinedresser.  Dwell in Me, and I will dwell in you.  Just as no branch
can bear fruit of itself without abiding in (being vitally united to) the
vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me.  I am the Vine<strong>;</strong>
you are the branches.  Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much
(abundant) fruit.  However, apart from Me you can do nothing.  If a person
does not dwell in Me, he 
is thrown out like a branch, and withers<strong>;</strong> such branches are
gathered up and thrown into the fire, and they are burned.<p>

<li><strong>John 15:16-19</strong> You have not chosen Me, but I have
chosen you and I have appointed you [I have planted you], that you might
go and bear fruit and keep on bearing, and that your fruit may be lasting, so that whatever you ask the Father in My
Name, He may give it to you.  This is what I command you<strong>:</strong> that you love
one another.  If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it
hated you.  If you belonged to the world, the world would treat you with
affection <em>and</em> would love you as its own.  But because you are not of the
world, but I have chosen (selected) you out of the
world, the world hates (detests) you.<p>

<li><strong>John 15:22-25</strong> If I had not come and spoken to them,
they would not be guilty of sin<strong>;</strong> but now they have no
excuse for their sin.  Whoever hates Me also hates My Father.  If I had
not done (accomplished) among them the works which no one else ever did,
they would not be guilty of sin.  But now they have both seen and have hated both Me and My Father.  But that the
word written in their Law might be fulfilled, They hated Me without a
cause.<p>

<font size=+1> <center><strong>Separating from Human-Mammalian
Characteristics</strong></center> </font> <p>

<li><strong>Matthew 19:9-12</strong> I say to you<strong>;</strong> whoever dismisses
(repudiates, divorces) his wife, except for unchastity, and marries
another commits adultery, <em>and he who marries a divorced woman commits
adultery</em>.  The disciples said to Him, If the case of a man with his wife
is like this, it is neither profitable <em>nor</em> advisable to marry.  But He
said to them, Not all men can accept this saying, but it is for those whom
it has been given.  For there are eunuchs who
have been born incapable of marriage<strong>;</strong> and there are eunuchs who have been
made so by men<strong>;</strong> and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable
of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  Let him who is able to
accept this accept it.<p>

<li><strong>Mark 12:25</strong> For when they shall arise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. (King James)<p>

<li><strong>Mark 13:17-19</strong> And Alas for those who are pregnant and
for those who have nursing babies in those days!  Pray that it may not
occur in winter.  For at that time there will be such affliction
(oppression and tribulation) as has not been from the beginning of the
creation which God created until this particular time - and positively never
will be.<p>

<li><strong>Luke 20:34-36</strong> And Jesus said to them, The people of
this world <em>and</em> present age marry and are given in marriage; But those who
are considered worthy to gain that other world <em>and</em> that future age and to
attain to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in
marriage; For they cannot die again, but they are angel-like <em>and</em> equal to
angels.  And being sons of <em>and</em> sharers in the resurrection, they are sons
of God.<p>

<li><strong>Luke 21:23</strong> Alas for those who are pregnant and for
those who have babies which they are nursing in those days!  For great
misery <em>and</em> anguish <em>and</em> distress shall be upon the land and indignation and
punishment <em>and</em> retribution upon this people.<p>

<font size=+1> <center><strong>These Last Days</strong></center>
</font><p>

<li><strong>Matthew 15:7-9</strong> Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. (King James)<p>

<li><strong>Luke 21:8-19</strong> And He said, Be on your guard and be
careful that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name,
saying, I am He! and, The time is at hand!  Do not go out after them.  And
when you hear of wars and insurrections (disturbances, disorder, and
confusion), do not become alarmed and panic-stricken and terrified; for
all this must take place first, but the end will not [come] immediately.
Then He told them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom.  There will be mighty and violent earthquakes, and in various
places famines and pestilences (plagues; malignant and contagious or
infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating); and there
will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven.  But previous to all
this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, turning you over
to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be led away before kings and
governors for My name's sake.  This will be a time (an opportunity) for
you to bear testimony.  Resolve and settle it in your minds not to
meditate and prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense and how
you will answer.  For I will give you a mouth and such utterance
and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against
or refute.  You will be delivered up and betrayed even by parents and
brothers and relatives and friends, and [some] of you they will put to
death.  And you will be hated (despised) by everyone because [you bear] My
name and for its sake.  But not a hair of your head shall perish.  By your
steadfastness and patient endurance you shall win the true life of your
souls.<p>

<font size=+1> <center><strong>Avoid Being Judgmental</strong></center>
</font><p> <li><strong>Matthew 7:1-2</strong> Do not judge <em>and</em> criticize
<em>and</em> condemn others, so that you may not be judged <em>and</em> criticized <em>and</em>
condemned yourselves.  For just as you judge <em>and</em> criticize <em>and</em> condemn
others, you will be judged <em>and</em> criticized <em>and</em> condemned, and in accordance
with the measure you deal out to others, it will be dealt out
again to you.  <p>

<li><strong>John 7:24</strong> Be honest in your judgment <em>and</em> do not
decide at a glance (superficially and by appearances); but judge fairly
and righteously.<p>

<li><strong>John 8:14-19</strong> Jesus answered, Even if I do testify on
My own behalf, My testimony is true and reliable and valid, for I know
where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come
from or where I am going.  You judge according to the flesh (by what you
see).  I do not judge or
condemn or sentence anyone.  Yet even if I do judge, My judgment is true;
for I am not alone, but I and the
Father, Who sent Me.  In your Law it is written that the testimony
(evidence) of two persons is reliable and valid.  I am One 
bearing testimony concerning Myself; and My Father, Who sent Me, He also
testifies about Me.  Then they said to Him, Where is this Father of Yours?
Jesus answered, You know My Father as little as you know Me.  If you knew
Me, you would know My Father also.  <p>

<font size=+1> <center><strong>Soul vs. Flesh Body</strong></center>
</font> <p> <li><strong>Matthew 10:28</strong> And do not be afraid of
those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be afraid of
Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.<p>

<li><strong>Luke 12:4-5</strong> I tell you, My friends, do not dread and
be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that
they can do.  But I will warn you whom you should fear; fear Him Who,
after killing, has power to hurl into hell; yes, I say to you fear Him!<p>

<li><strong>Psalms 103:13-18</strong> As a father loves and pities his
children, so the Lord loves and pities those who fear Him [with reverence,
worship, and awe].  For He knows our frame, He remembers and imprints that
we are dust.  As for man, his days are as grass<strong>;</strong> as a flower of the field,
so he flourishes.  For the wind passes over it and it is gone, and its
place shall know it no more.  But the mercy and loving-kindness of the
Lord are from everlasting to everlasting upon those who reverently and
worshipfully fear Him, and His righteousness is to children's children.
To such as keep His covenant [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]
and to those who remember His commandments to do them.  <p>

<li><strong>Isaiah 40:6-8</strong> A voice says, Cry [prophesy]!  And I
said, What shall I cry?  [The voice answered, Proclaim<strong>:</strong>]  All flesh is as
frail as grass, and all that makes it attractive [its kindness, its
goodwill, its mercy from God, its glory and comeliness, however good] is
transitory, like the flower of the fieled.  The grass withers, the flower
fades, when the breath of the Lord blows upon it<strong>;</strong> surely [all] the people
are like grass.  The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our
God will stand forever.
