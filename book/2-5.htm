<hr/><h2> <strong> <center> THE 17 STEPS </center></strong></h2><hr/>
<p>1.   Can you follow instructions without adding your own interpretation? <p>
<p>
2. Can you deliver instructions as you receive them or do they change according to your computer?  <p>
<p>
3. Do you participate in inconsiderate conversation, polluting the ears of others while you and your partner work
      things out?  <p>
<p>
4. Are you physically clumsy - breaking things because you handle them too harshly or carelessly?  <p>
<p>
5. Do you half way complete a task because of your poor
      standard of what is thorough?  <p>
<p>
6. Do you put tasks off - procrastinate?  <p>
<p>
7. Are your patterns of cleanliness, sensitivity,
      gentleness, etc. consistent or are they good only when
      spotlighted?  <p>
<p>
8. Do you use more of something than is adequate (for
      example, excessively high cooking flame, more toothpaste than
      necessary, etc.)?  <p>
<p>
9. Do you go from one extreme to another:  as from
      overeating to undereating, etc.?  <p>
<p>
10. Are you sensitive when approaching another individual
      about something you want to discuss?  Do you permit that
      individual the choice to continue what he is doing, or do you
      force him to drop it in order to give attention to you?  Do
      you stop and check, or do you assume that what is on your
      mind is more important than what is on theirs?  (Know the
      difference between your relationship with your teachers and
      your fellow classmates in this regard.)<p>
<p>
11. Do you needlessly ask a question when the answer is
      obvious or a moment of silent observation would quickly
      reveal the answer?  <p>
<p>
12. Are you pushy, aggressive, interfering, or demanding in
      any way?  <p>
<p>
13. Has familiarity caused you to become so relaxed with
      your partners or others that your actions or words don't hold
      enough restraint? <p>
<p> 
14. Are you gentle, simple, cautious, and thoughtfully
      restrained in your steps and all other physical actions or
      words?  <p>
<p>
15. Have you outgrown defensiveness and its flip side,
      martyrdom?<p>
<p>
16. Can you understand and review in your mind all the ways
      in which members of the Next Level are sensitive?  If you
      can, you have no excuse for not working on improving in these
      areas at all times.<p>
<p>
17. When your teachers have asked someone to do a task and
      it relates to you, do you treat that task and its deliverers
      with as much respect as you would if it came directly from
      your teachers?
