<ul>
<li>Those who are unhappy with what this world has to offer, or are
seeking the <em>real</em> Truth, have turned to New Age, Eastern religions, or
simply have "dropped out" to indulge in whatever excesses might bring them
pleasure.  And why shouldn't they? <a name="lnk1"></a>Who can blame
them?  Nowhere, especially not in the churches, can they find the answers to
the purpose of their existence or any hope for a soul's future.
<strong>The most significant information, that which was offered 2000
years ago by a Representative from the "future" - the Evolutionary Level
Above Human (the real Kingdom of Heaven), has been completely ignored or
obscured.</strong>  That Representative's "hard-core" teaching - the <a
name="lnk2"></a><em>formula </em>for entering "His Father's Kingdom" (that
Evolutionary Level Above Human) - cannot be found anywhere on the planet,
least of all in the teachings of the churches.  <strong><a
name="lnk5"></a>The Christians have unwittingly even become their own
dreaded <em>Anti-Christ</em>.</strong>  Jesus had no wife nor children,
His followers were His "family." He required of His students (disciples)
that they drop <em>everything </em>(all possessions, ties, and
attachments) and literally go with Him.  He warned His "followers" that
their enemies would likely be those of their own household, that they
would be hated by all men, and that as they adopted more of His ways and
thinking, they would <em>hate</em> or <em>abhor everything</em> that could pull
them back into their "old" world (including their human father, mother,
wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even the love of <em>their own
life</em>), or anything that could <em>interfere </em>with their
commitment to Him and His Father's Kingdom.

<li><a name="lnk7"></a>Jesus was <em>not </em>a religious man or spiritual person according
to present day interpretation.  He was a man of the <em>future </em>- 
from the future, ahead of this civilization's time - from an actual
physical Evolutionary Kingdom Level above the human kingdom, in the same
way that humans are "supposedly" an evolutionary kingdom level above
Earth's animal kingdom.  <strong>Members of the Kingdom Level Above Human
<em>identify with</em> or think of themselves as the "spirit" or "soul,"
and their body as a "container."  Whereas members of the human kingdom
primarily identify with or think of themselves as the physical body (and
wonder if they <em>might </em>have a soul).</strong>  Members of the
Kingdom that He - the one who was in Jesus - came from, treat their
physical bodies as "suits of clothes" and thereby can leave those "Next
Level" bodies behind and even incarnate into a human body as He did.
<strong>The mind or spirit that was in Jesus did <em>not </em>incarnate in
the infant, but rather it incarnated when the body He took was
approximately 29 to 30 years old</strong> - at the event recorded in the
Bible as the "Holy Spirit" descending upon Him as a dove.  Compared to a
human spirit, His Spirit, having come from that Next Kingdom Level, was a
pure or "Holy" Spirit, revered by His disciples - seen as Divine - and
rightfully so.  The body that was "picked" for Him had been monitored and
"prepped" since infancy by Members of the Kingdom Level Above Human in
anticipation of the day that He would "take it over" or incarnate into it.

<li><strong> In the same way, in this generation, two bodies were "picked"
and "prepped" for the two members from that "Next Level" who would
incarnate in them, a Younger Member and an Older Member - a "Son" and his
"Father."  This time those two Representatives incarnated into their picked
or chosen bodies in the early 1970's, bodies that were in their
40's.</strong>  They then, in 1975, put out a "call" for the souls who
came with them for this task, and these two Teachers assisted those
prospective members of that Next Kingdom Level in incarnating into (taking
over) the bodies that had been set aside for them.  These two Teachers
then literally took these prospective members out of, or "lifted them out"
of the world with the bodies they would take charge of.  They assisted the
students in the tedious and difficult process of becoming <em>new creatures</em> - filling
those bodies with the <em>mind</em>, the <em>thoughts</em>, the
<em>behavior</em>, the "<em>spirit</em>" from the Kingdom Level Above
Human.  This classroom was in total seclusion for almost 18 years.

<li>These students of the Next Level have now been given the task of going
out and finding the second and last wave or "harvest" of souls or spirits
who have been brought back into the human kingdom to receive -
<em>incarnate into</em> - the bodies that have been picked and prepped for
<em>them.</em>  As the prospective members of the second harvest connect with the
students from the first - and learn from them - they too will be
<em>literally </em>taken out of the world and through the
incarnating process - the taking over of a body, aborting its human mind
and programming, and filling it with the <em>mind</em> of their <em>Teacher</em>,
and of <em>His Older Member</em>, and of that <em>Kingdom Level Above
Human</em>.

<li><strong> Those <em>souls</em> who successfully bond to their <em>new
</em>"Father" and His Kingdom will literally leave the human
kingdom</strong> and become members in the physical Kingdom from whence
came the mind (the soul) that was in Jesus, and the minds (the souls) that
<em>are </em>in these two Teachers.  As Jesus came and left in a "cloud of
light," so also these Teachers, along with their students from both
harvests, came - and will leave - in the same manner (a spacecraft,
"UFO," belonging to the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God).  They will not
need to be a part of the human kingdom again.  These who have successfully
overcome human-mammalian <em>behavior </em>and <em>thinking </em>("washed
their robes" under the tutorship of their Teachers), and have replaced it
with the behavior and thinking of that <em>Next Kingdom Level</em>, are
now ready for <strong>service,</strong> for the first time, to the
<em>true</em> Kingdom of Heaven - the only <em>real </em>Kingdom of
God.

<li>All souls retain, at all evolutionary levels, the <em>free will</em>
to accept tutorship, remain loyal to their parentage in that Kingdom
Level, or separate, feeling that they no longer need to remain a child, a
servant - even in the Kingdom of Heaven.  The spirit or soul referred to
as Satan or Lucifer was once a child, a son, in the real Kingdom of
Heaven.  He exercised his "free will" to go his separate way and attempt
to create his "own heaven."  He even took what was estimated to be
one-third of the creatures who were young children in that Kingdom with
him, for they were still susceptible to his leadership.  Those individuals
now circulate in the Heavens, and we refer to them as various
<strong>"Luciferian" space races</strong> (who also travel in their more
primitive spacecrafts, or UFOs).  Having lost their standing in the true
Kingdom of Heaven or the Kingdom of their CREATOR, they <strong>had no
choice but to return to human-like behavior and mammalian
limitations.</strong>  They use the humans for their own purposes, and do
all within their power to prohibit the humans from ever knowing the truth
about their ex-Father's Kingdom.  <a name="lnk4"></a><strong>They bind the
human souls to this world through: a preoccupation with sexuality</strong>
(indulgence in all the pleasures/addictions of the human senses);
<strong>reproductivity</strong> (family); <strong>service to the human
kingdom </strong>(within a structure of indebtedness and credit); and non-
disputable, "moral" <strong>responsibility to their family, community,
race, nation, and their unknowingly distorted <em>religious
</em>concepts.</strong>

<li><a name="lnk6"></a>Many Bible students, some Christian denominations,
and to a greater extent the so-called "charismatics" or "spirit-filled"
say they are waiting for the "Second Coming."  <strong>That same
<em>mind</em>, that same <em>information </em>of the <em>true </em>Kingdom
of Heaven, which was in Jesus, has come again, for the "second time," in
this civilization. </strong> That <em>mind</em>, the one that spoke
through the body named Jesus, told His followers that He would come again,
though He also told them not to believe any who would say that "Jesus"
(the name of His human body 2000 years ago) was on "this mountain" or in
"that desert," for that "body" would <strong>not</strong> return.  The two events 
that most Christians say they are eagerly anticipating have occurred:
<em>the "Second Coming"</em> (as just described) and <em>the "Raptures"</em>
(the first of which happened in 1975-76, the second of which is occurring
now as the second harvest is "lifted out" of their world).
<a name="lnk3"></a>The Luciferians, who have taken over the religions, would
have their "faithful" die and go to their "heaven" without doing any of the
necessary <em>overcoming</em>, for "He did it all" - "He shed His blood" -
in order that you might "be saved." <strong>You <em>can't</em> simply be a
good "Christian," die, and go to the <em>true</em> Kingdom of Heaven.  You
can only become a <em>new creature</em>, a <em>Heavenly creature</em>, while a
Member of the Kingdom Level Above Human is incarnate in the human kingdom
to take you through that "<em>birthing</em>."</strong>  That <em>birthing
</em>requires that you become <strong>dead</strong> to all
<strong>humanness</strong> and have <em>only</em> the <em>consciousness</em> - the
<em>mind</em> - of a <em>child</em> in that <em>new Kingdom Level</em> -
totally under the <em>care </em>and <em>keeping </em>of your "<em>new
Father</em>" (Older Member), your "<em>new family</em>," who takes you
into that <em>Kingdom</em>.

<li><strong> This is obviously, by human judgment, the "Cult of
Cults"</strong> - but for the chosen, it's the <em>only way</em> into
their "<em>Heavenly Father's House</em>."  You will have to judge for
yourselves who we are.  <strong>The Church,</strong> the New Age, and the
Charismatics <strong>will likely call <em>us </em>the Anti-Christ, for we
don't simply stand for "peace," "love," and "light" for this
world.</strong></ul> <center><strong>For more information and discussion on this
