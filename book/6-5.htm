<center><strong><h3><em>CREW FROM THE EVOLUTIONARY LEVEL ABOVE HUMAN
OFFERS</em> <strong>-</strong></h3> <h2><font size=+3><em>LAST CHANCE</em>  TO
ADVANCE</font></h2> <h1><font size=+7>BEYOND
HUMAN</font></h1></strong></center>
 
<center>(<em>If you don't want <strong>out</strong> of the human kingdom, you
don't want <strong>into</strong> the Kingdom Level Above Human</em>.)</center>

<ul><h4><strong>MEMBERS OF THAT CREW ARE HERE TO SPEAK ON:
</strong></h4></ul>
<ul>
<li>How the Evolutionary Level Above Human <strong>-</strong> what
religions call the "Kingdom of God" <strong>-</strong> is a many-membered
Kingdom <strong>-</strong> a <strong><em>physical</em></strong> Kingdom
Level above the human kingdom (with souls, minds, and
<strong><em>bodies</em> -</strong> not just "spirit").  This Kingdom
Level makes its "Headquarters" in the most <em>distant</em> segment of the
Heavens <strong>-</strong> outside of "time" <strong>-</strong> from
whence all Creation originates, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial.

<li>How membership in the Kingdom Level Above Human is attained
<strong>-</strong> by outgrowing or rising above (overcoming) all
human-mammalian characteristics and behavior under the direct personal
tutorship of a member or members of that Kingdom while they are incarnate
in human bodies.

<li>How  <strong>-</strong> <em>now</em> at the close of this Age
<strong>-</strong> the door to that Kingdom is briefly open.

<li>How <strong><em>life</em></strong>, from the Next Level's point of
view, begins when a soul receives from that Kingdom Level a
"<em>deposit</em> of recognition" of the information regarding that
Kingdom Level's existence, and recognition of a Representative from that
Level Above Human.  The soul can choose to accept further
<strong><em>life</em></strong>, or "nourishment," from members of that
Level indefinitely, or reject it at any point and fall back into ignorance
or "death."

<li>How these Representatives from the Evolutionary Level Above Human
incarnated (took adult human bodies) in the mid-1970's and have been
"separate from the world" <strong>-</strong> practicing non-sexual,
non-mammalian behavior <strong>-</strong> for the past 18 years.

<li>How religions have, in fact, <strong>unknowingly</strong> become
victims of slavery to Luciferian forces   <strong>-</strong> "space
races" who represent themselves to humans as "gods," but who are nothing
more than technically advanced humans (clinging to human behavior) from
previous civilizations, who use the discarnate (spirit) world to keep
humans preoccupied with their addictions, and who travel in primitive
"UFOs."  (The Next Level <strong>-</strong> the <em>true</em> Kingdom
of God <strong>-</strong> has the only truly advanced space-time travel
vehicles, or spacecrafts.)

<li>How human physical bodies are only <em>containers</em> (suits of
clothes) for souls<strong>;</strong> how the <em>soul</em> is the <em>true
identity</em><strong>;</strong> and how invasive influences and discarnate
spirits can be recognized, dealt with, and aborted.

<li>How <strong><em>this</em></strong> information is the
<strong><em>same</em></strong> information that the Next Level sent with
its Representative 2000 years ago.

<li>Now that "test time" is here, <strong>who</strong> will be able to
<em>believe</em> this information and <em>accept</em> these as crew
members from the Evolutionary Level Above Human?  </ul>
