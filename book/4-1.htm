<font size=+6>T</font>he <strong><em>Beyond Human</em></strong> series of video tapes, which we recorded in late
1991/early 1992, were broadcast at that time via satellite TV.
These video tapes represent the most comprehensive presentation
of our material to the public in our 21-year mission.  Twelve in-depth discussions of who we are, Next Level conduct, and Next
Level thinking are presented in 10 one-hour sessions and two
longer sessions for a total of approximately 13&#189 hours.  Complete
transcripts of all 12 sessions are included in this section.<p>

     During this time period, we used the name <strong>Total Overcomers
Anonymous</strong>, which we felt accurately described our position - that
is, our desire to overcome all aspects of the human kingdom,
while remaining at the same time, both separate and anonymous.
