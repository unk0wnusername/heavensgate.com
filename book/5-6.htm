<h3><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>
<ul>
<LI> The Next Level's desire is to help (or nourish) souls.  They are
eager to assist any creatures who are heading in the right direction of
their own volition.  If they think you have the capacity to respond to
this, and <strong><em>they</em></strong> want to <strong><em>give you</em></strong> an
opportunity to receive it, then a member of the Next Level actually
<em>puts you in contact</em> with the information that is presented in our
ad, "<em>Final Offer <strong>-</strong> from the Evolutionary Level Above Human</em>."  It
was the Next Level's presence, standing right beside you, that explains
that powerful response you felt as you first read the ad.<p>

<li> At this point, the Next Level observes closely how you choose to
respond, knowing they can only help you if you <strong>ask</strong> them.
Even though the Next Level may have "touched" you, your response is not
predetermined.  There will be forces aggressively trying to turn you away
from this, and completely non-aggressive Members of the Next Level
available to assist <em> if you ask</em> for their help.  It is up to you
to decide which voice to listen to.  Many who sincerely feel astounded by
the ad and that it rocks their very foundation, will likely decide, "It
requires too much; it means I'd have to change everything; I wish I had
never seen it."  Others may listen to thoughts that come from another
"god" or alien group that say, "Don't pay any attention to this <strong>-</strong> they're
just some 'cult' or New Age antichrist."  But if you read the ad, and then
<em>use the terminology</em> in the ad to <em>connect</em>, by saying,
<strong><em>"Next Level <strong>-</strong> if this is true, help me to perceive
it,"</em></strong> then the Next Level will be there to assist you as long
as <em>you keep asking</em>, until you are physically in contact with the
classroom.<p>

<li>So, if you are one who felt a powerful response and a recognition, a
knowing deep inside that this is something you must pursue, then you are
invited to <em>make application</em> for entry into the classroom <strong>-</strong> hoping
that the strength of your <em>desire </em>to become a part of the Next
Level, the degree of your <em>thirst </em>to grow and change, and your
understanding of what the requirements are, find you <em>acceptable
</em>as a beginning student.  It is the content and quality of your soul
(or what is in your heart) that finds you now a candidate.<p>

<li>In other words, the Next Level or the <em>true </em>Kingdom of God is
extremely selective, and to be considered as a candidate is an honor.
Therefore, it is the <em>student </em>who begins with a <em>trial</em>
period, rather than the student feeling that the classroom is on
<em>trial</em>.  If the Next Level has truly "drawn you to us," then it
will be your desire to <em>prove to the Next Level</em> that <em>you
</em>are worthy and ready.  We understand that you may have doubts
regarding your <em>own ability</em> to conquer your weak areas, and this
can be a healthy attitude <strong>-</strong> one that encourages you to trust and to seek
help from your classmates and Teachers.<p>

<li> We know at first you may have experienced some degree of skepticism
or doubt, but if you are continuing to wonder whether or not you are a
part of us, or seem to desire more "proof," or are hesitant to sever your
ties or conquer your addictions <strong>-</strong> these are all indications that this may
not be the right place or time for you.  However, if deep down you feel
like, "I have no choice <strong>-</strong> something inside me tells me I <em>must
</em>proceed with this <strong>-</strong> at least take another step," in other words, if
you <em>know </em>that your relationship with the Next Level is the
<em>only </em>thing that makes any sense to you, then we will be able to
serve in the capacity of helping you.<p>

<li>If you believe that we truly do represent the Kingdom of God, then you
can understand why you cannot enter the classroom on <em>your</em> terms.
You cannot "call the shots," or be concerned about having a position of
leadership or needing recognition.  Further, you would want only the Next
Level, through its procedures, to be your guidance.  A student who <em>is</em> a
part of this family will grow to value flexibility and know that whatever
instruction he receives is exactly what he needs for his most accelerated
growth.<p></ul> 

<h3><strong>POSSESSIONS</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Understanding</strong></h4> <ul>

<li>Part of the process of separating from and "overcoming" the world (the
human kingdom) requires trust <strong>-</strong> trust that if you truly relinquish
yourself, including your care and keeping, to those in the Next Level, all
of your needs will be taken care of.<p>

<li> For the serious student, hanging onto possessions or situations that
offer worldly security prevents and interferes with "letting go" of that
which binds you to the human kingdom <strong>-</strong> you unknowingly impose upon
yourself limitations that will restrict your potential for change.  In
other words, after clearly deciding this is all you want, an "ace in the
hole" could be a serious obstacle to accelerated change.<p>

<li>The transitional process requires a total commitment, and as long as
you keep one foot in the world, that foothold will continue to hold you
back (will keep you attached and bound to this level) and prevent you from
completing your task.<p></ul>
<h4><strong> Practical Application</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li>Upon first entering the classroom (beginning a trial period), we don't
feel it is necessary in all cases for you to have completely "burned
<em>all </em>your bridges."  In other words, we could understand how some
individuals might leave their affairs in such a way that they would not
find themselves without any means of support (or without a way to take
care of their needs) if they should decide, after a brief orientation, to
return to the human world.  However, a prospective student would be open
and honest about what bridges have not been burned.  If you have any
"hidden agenda" for recovering your human existence "if this doesn't work
out," it means you have doubts as to who you are or who we are, and the
classroom experience cannot work for you.<p>

<li>During the "trial period" or until the student proves to be on "solid
ground" and has convinced us that he has no intention of "turning back"
(wanting to recover his life in the world), <strong>the possessions that
you bring in will be set aside</strong> and not be considered as part of
the class resources.<p>

<li>However, before becoming a "full-fledged" class member or "candidate"
(after successfully completing a trial period), each student would arrive
at the point of not desiring to have any personal possessions.<p>

<li>The classroom circumstance is not one of martyrdom.  We have always
been taken care of very comfortably.  Items and possessions are all shared
<strong>-</strong> there is no personal or individual ownership.<p>

<li>Some individuals have entered with virtually no possessions, while
others have made sizable contributions.  It makes no difference to us in
which circumstance you find yourself, and it in no way reflects your level
of growth or readiness.  The Next Level designs each individual's
circumstance with exactly the proper elements for that particular soul's
maximum potential for growth.</ul>
<p> <h3><strong>RELATIONSHIPS</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Ties with your past would have to be severed <em>before </em>you enter
the classroom.  (This does not imply that we might not have occasional
instructions for calls, letters, or visits.)  Also, the influences that
cause us to feel "pangs" from that severance may still have to be dealt
with <em>in</em> the classroom, but this is an example of the withdrawal <strong>-</strong> the
overcoming process <strong>-</strong> that occurs.<p>

<li>Everyone is led to this information <em>individually</em>, and your
overcoming is individual.  In the world there is nothing wrong with the
relationships you had, but once you begin this overcoming process, then
those relationships can't help but hold you back.  It would be like trying
to live in two worlds at the same time.  It is possible that individuals
from the same family unit (spouse, parent, brother, sister) may find
themselves as candidates.  Even as prospective candidates, individuals
must speak or relate to us only for themselves and not for friends or
relations.  Once in the classroom, they would learn to relate to each
other only as task partners and crew members.<p>

<li>There are no children (or minors) among us.  It is our understanding that souls capable of making the decision to separate from the world would be housed in mature vehicles (bodies).  Every class
member is celibate, so certainly no children have been born into our
group.<p>

<li>You can be assured that those you leave behind will be taken care of
and watched over by the Next Level.  They will be in the hands of their
Heavenly Father, who knows what they need and how to help them.<p></ul>
<h3><strong>ADDICTIONS</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>What we are doing in our overcoming is breaking the binds of humanism
(of this civilization).  Which means that anything you are <em>bound
</em>to that is uncommon to the Next Level, you will have to be free of.
You are literally becoming a new creature.<p>

<li>There are many commonly recognized addictions, such as alcoholism,
sensuality, tobacco use, drug addiction, love addiction, etc.  Members of
the class, no matter what they may have participated in prior to joining
the classroom, no longer smoke, drink, take drugs, or participate in
sexuality to any degree, and this is expected of you also.<p>

<li>We also consider many types of behavior and characteristics
undesirable, because the vehicle (body) uses them to satisfy a human
desire and because they are not characteristics of the Next Level.  More
specifically, your vehicle has in its genes the programming of likes and
dislikes (such as brands of toothpaste or types of foods), habits,
opinions, judgments, and ways of expressing yourself, from the many
generations of your vehicle's family strain, most of which are foreign to
the Next Level.  Plus your soul is picking up <strong>-</strong> where it left off <strong>-</strong> on
what it has not yet overcome from previous incarnations.  In the Next
Level's eyes, these things are not very different from an alcohol or drug
addiction.  Examples are many of the little habits we unconsciously get
into, and certain patterns of thinking, behavior, and responses, such as
being critical of others or getting down on yourself, having negative
responses to situations, needing to to talk constantly, having things <em>your</em> way or on a particular timetable, or needing human affection or attention.<p> 

<li>The classroom, as part of its design, "surfaces" the habits and
characteristics that each individual needs to rise above.  For the most
part, you will be able to drop or shed many of these characteristics
easily <strong>-</strong> even the more hard-core addictions can rapidly disappear.</ul><p>
<h3><emp><strong>TRIAL PERIOD</strong></emp></h3> Before you can be a
full-fledged class member, you must first arrive at a place in your
understanding, attitude, and control that demonstrates to your classmates
and Teachers that you are on solid ground <strong>-</strong> you are stable.  It is the
classroom that makes that determination, which will be based, in part, on
the following:<p> <ul>

<li>You have already severed your ties to human relationships and
possessions (as described under "Relationships" and "Possessions").<br>

<li>You recognize that you are part of this <em>family</em> and want only to adopt
the ways of the Next Level as demonstrated in this classroom <strong>-</strong> nothing
threatens your <strong><em>total</em></strong> commitment.<br>

<li>You see the value in asking for, accepting, and applying the help (per
Next Level ways and procedures) offered by your classmates and
Teachers.</ul><p>

In the classroom, we all maintain certain basic, minimum standards of
<em>control</em> of our vehicles' behavior and responses.  There are basic
requirements of Next Level conduct that we expect of ourselves and that we
would expect of any newcomers as well.  The trial period offers us a
chance to observe your degree of control and restraint and helps us learn
the areas you might need to work on.  There are certain types of conduct
that are unacceptable in our classroom <strong>-</strong> such as deceit, lying,
sensuality, or permitting verbal outbursts or physical abuse (such as
harsh words, sarcasm, hurtful teasing, loss of temper, anger).  Also, we
strive daily to improve our standards in all areas of <em>restraint</em> <strong>-</strong> like
controlling excessive talking, noise level, or the inappropriate offering
of suggestions <strong>-</strong> and we work consistently at not permitting human
characteristics such as negativity, selfishness, vanity, or defensiveness
to express their presence.<p>

Though these requirements are seriously stated, this is not to suggest
that the class doesn't enjoy a lot of fun, good humor, and appropriate
pleasures.<p>

If you find that this class is not what you want (whether you are unable
to really sever ties to the world, or the standards in the class seem too
demanding, <em>whatever</em> the reason), you are free to leave at any time.
Likewise, if it seems to us that you are reluctant to change your behavior
(clinging to worldly traits), we might suggest that the classroom is not
appropriate for you.  In either case, we will help you (in the ways that
we can) make your transition back into the world.<p>
