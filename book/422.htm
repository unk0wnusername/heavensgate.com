Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 4
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr>

Welcome to the fourth session in our series, <em>Beyond Human
-- The Last Call</em>. Well, I have to take the position of assuming
that you have watched Sessions 1, 2, and 3. And if you really
are trying to understand it, I hope you've watched them more than
once. Now it's time for number 4. We're trying something different
today. We haven't tried this before. We had a session earlier
today, and we're going to try a second one in the same day. We're
asking Ti and our helpers in our Father's Kingdom to bear with
us, and we hope this is their desire, and if it isn't, I'm sure
they'll let us know. We'll get right on with our questions because
the way we are now designing our format is to listen to our previous
session, and recognize the things that could be enlarged upon,
or clarified some, and we then redo our questions. I think you're
the next one on our question list. What is your question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Do you want to start off talking about "two containers"
and the Trinity?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, two containers and the Trinity. That sounds like a
strange combination, doesn't it? What do they mean by "two
containers"? Earlier, in Session 3, we discussed the "vehicle,"
the "soul," the "mind." We said that the
soul was the container for the mind, and we kind of assumed in
that same picture that the vehicle is a container for the soul.
In a sense, that's correct, even though the soul encompasses
probably a little bit more space than the vehicle takes up. But
it's a good working hypothesis to consider the vehicle a container
for the soul, and the soul a container for the mind. So, keep
in mind that we don't listen to the impulses of the vehicle. 
We're the ones that have the choice, the free will, the options,
the listening capacity, and the decision-making capacity for what
direction to take mind into the soul or into our package of information
- our "pillowcase," or our container for information
- by asking in the direction of our Father's Kingdom, or, if we're
not careful, listening to things we didn't ask for.
<p>
Now, how does that fit in as part of the same question of what's
the Trinity? A concept that has been so misunderstood, and so
debated over the years, in doctrine, in the churches is the Trinity.
When someone is a member of our Father's Kingdom, even if they
are visiting or on a task in the human kingdom, but if they are
a member of our Father's Kingdom, they are a "Trinity."
They are within themselves a Trinity in the truest sense of its
meaning. We just discussed the two vehicles and the mind. How
am I, if I am a member of my Father's Kingdom and I am on an assigned
task in the human kingdom, how am I a Trinity? Father, Son, Holy
Ghost - Holy Spirit. Father<strong>:</strong> I am, because of my task and because
of my station in my Father's Kingdom, I am a Father to children.
I am a piece of pipe in this conduit that serves younger ones,
newer ones, and therefore I am a "Father" to "sons."
In the same sense, Ti and I both served in the same capacity,
and still both serve in the capacity as Fathers to these students,
I am a Father. I am a son - I am a son of my Heavenly Father.
In a sense, since Ti is older, I am son to Ti. Ti is, in a sense,
my Father. Now, I can be a Father even to grandchildren. And
sons can even look to a Father, that is, if you want to use the
human analogy, even a grandfather. Even if I want to say that
Ti is my Father, and the Father that was the Father to the partnership
is still the same Father that even the classroom can associate
with. But they've been taught, and they've learned from experience,
that if they start looking to that which they cannot know on a
<em>personal</em> basis...remember, in previous lessons we've talked
about a personal basis and a point of identification, a personal
relationship with a member of the Kingdom of Heaven is what keeps
you on track.
<p>
If my Heavenly Father, or the Heavenly Father that was the one
above Ti and Do, has assigned Ti and Do to do a task with these
students, and He has ordained that task, He has approved that
task, He has the authority to establish that task, I'm afraid
He does not permit you to bypass it. He says, "Look, I've
given them to you. If you know Me, you'll see Me in them. If
you don't see Me in them, either they aren't of Me or I am not
in them, or you do not have the capacity to recognize Me."
The same was true in Jesus' case, those who listened to Him,
those who were His students, His disciples, those who called Him
"teacher" or "rabbi" or "shepherd,"
they could not go off and pray to His Father. They did not know
His Father. They knew Him. Plus His Father had said, "This
is my Son of whom I am well pleased. <em>Listen to Him</em>! I've
given Him to you and He's certainly more than adequate to fill
the bill for your needs." Now Luci jumps in and boy! he
has a heyday with that one, because he can try to shoot that one
down in every direction. But if you know our Father, you will
recognize that to be true. If you <em>want</em> our Father, and
you continue to test that truth, you continue to test that truth
and the world does not pull you back, your assurance, or your
knowing that you are on the right path will increase and increase
and increase. It's certainly expected of you, as it was these
students, as it was with Ti and Do. When Ti and I were first
awakening, goodness, we thought, "How can two people go insane
at the same time, in the same ways"? All of a sudden we
were thrown together and we were as different as night and day.
We'd been together only a few months, and the next thing you
know this information was coming into our heads that we'd come
from the Kingdom of Heaven to deliver some information about what
the truth is in the Kingdom of Heaven and how you get from the
human kingdom into that Kingdom of Heaven. Goodness, we couldn't
understand.
<p>
The point I'm making is, doubt is a common lesson ground. You
can't expect to not go through it. I know that any of you that
are listening today could easily doubt everything I'm saying.
I <em>expect</em> you to doubt. I <em>want</em> you to doubt it.
If you know my Father, you cannot put Him to any test that He
cannot win,<em> if</em> you continue to pursue Him, and you are
not overcome by the forces that would turn you astray. Jesus
warned<strong>:</strong> 'Don't worry about losing your life. Worry about losing
your soul.' Because there are those in Satan's kingdom who would
even rob the souls of the elect - those that are chosen to
get closer. So, this is a dangerous business. Doubt is par for
the course. We don't expect you to not have to deal with it.
Did I answer your question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I think you covered it pretty well.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, what's next on your list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Can a human vehicle be considered or recognized as a
perennial?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I'm glad you asked that because I realized in Session 3 that
when we talked about the tulip, or when that information was given
to us, then later as we listened to that session, more information
came to clarify this issue. A good illustration of how the human
plant is a perennial is to think of the family tree of the human
vehicle - the human plant. Let's say the family tree is the "Thompson"
tree. Those who call themselves "Thompsons" have a
tie to that tree. Now, you're really tied to a couple of trees
in the human kingdom. Let's say, for example, a female is not
only tied to the tree of her mother and father, but she's also
tied to the tree that she moves into by marriage. So, in a sense,
she has two trees that she's been tied to. And depending upon
which one she is the most tied to, is the most likelihood she
would return to the next time she came up from the "bulb
under the ground" like the tulip. In other words, if the
Thompson family is the perennial plant, then for a vehicle to
die and a soul that is in a human condition leaves that plant,
it's no different than a leaf from the Thompson plant wilting
and falling. And for every leaf that falls, one or two more leaves
come back, and they, in that same Thompson branch, will be filled
by the soul that is standing in line to get in that Thompson branch,
that extension of that family tree, according to the degree of
their bind with that family tree.
<p>
A funny thing here about using the name "Thompson,"
when you're in the process of overcoming, one of the things that
helps you is to take a new name. This is adopted in a way in
the Catholic church when nuns and some of the monks or hermits
- some of the ones who isolate themselves more in thoughtful, studying
conditions - they take another name. They take the name of a saint
or some Biblical name and it helps disassociate them from the
family tree. It helps get their mind more on their pursuit of
their concept of God. I must admit to you, and this is one of
our secrets, but in our whole session, in our group of sessions
here with you, we're telling information that have been our secrets
for many years. And now some of those secrets are being passed
on to you. I do this with reluctance because I know of how it
hurts some family members, and yet no intent is ever meant to
hurt a family member. That's not the way of our Father's Kingdom.
But the <em>truth</em> is that that soul belongs to - if that
soul has any mind of our Father in it, even if it doesn't
- the soul still belongs to our Heavenly Father.
<p>
When a soul begins to recognize its true parentage, it cannot
help but relate to its parentage. The soul was <em>created</em>.
If that soul is going to move into a Kingdom level that only
relates at the Creation basis - not the reproductive basis as
known in the human kingdom - it's going to relate to its Father,
the one above it, the one that nurtured it, the one that taught
it, the one that brought it through a womb, so to speak, from
the human kingdom into the Heavenly Kingdom. So, part of what
we do in our classroom is we take other names that have no particular
significance. I spoke of these two students, and yet the names
I use for them are not the ones you'd find on their driver's license
or birth certificates of the vehicles they're wearing. But it
applies to them satisfactorily - to the soul. All they are
is the soul, because that is what they have become. They do not
relate to the family tree that the vehicle they're wearing relates
to any longer. They are denied that. They <em>must</em> be denied
that. That family tree, because of its methods of even remaining
a family tree, has become corrupted because of the influence of
Lucifer's camp.
<p>
At this point, I want to apologize to all the Lucy's out there,
and I'll try not to use that term again. I'll use "Lucifer"
or I'll try to use "Satan." Because I certainly don't
want the Lucille's or the Lucy's to feel, "Goodnight! I
can't stand to listen to that guy because he speaks of Satan using
my name." It's interesting that we bring this up when we're
talking about names. If you come this way, you'll lose that one
anyhow. I'm teasing. But I do apologize, and I'll try to remember
to make the reference "Satan" and "Lucifer,"
because I do not like to offend you.
<p>
Our Heavenly Father does not like for you to be offended by anything
of His that we deliver to you. Our Heavenly Father does not like
for the families of the physical vehicles of the classroom to
be hurt by what the students are doing. The families have the
same thing that we possess - they have that little option<strong>;</strong> they
have that free will. Look, the families of these two students
can say, "I may not understand what they are doing, what
they are pursuing, but I know they are trying to get closer to
their Heavenly Father. And I've just got to put them in His hands
and trust that He will lead them in the right direction and not
let them go astray." That is their option. Or they can
hate me. I would hate for them to hate me. Not because I hate
to be hated. I would hate for them to have to be responsible
for hating an instrument that has been chosen by the Kingdom of
Heaven to be a vessel or a megaphone, an instrument for the Truth
to be delivered to those who want to move out of the human condition
into the Kingdom of Heaven. I've dreaded this topic, but we have
to discuss it.
<p>
The students probably have several names. Take, for example,
a student named "Susie." She has one that, should she
get stopped in a traffic jam or she turns when she shouldn't at
a stop sign, is the right legal one on her driver's license, and
she doesn't hesitate to use it. But she doesn't identify with
that name at all. She has another name that she uses should she
need to work in the world in order to sustain our tummies or to
put gasoline in the cars that we drive. That name is probably
part of the name that showed up on that birth certificate or that
driver's license, and she'll use that name at her work because
it's <em>not </em>the one that the <em>old</em> influences or the
<em>old</em> vehicle's impulses would respond to. So, frequently
this is what we do, and the only reason that I'm telling you this
is because we're in Session 4 now of this series, and if <em>you're</em>
getting more and more interested, you're trying to think, "Whoa!
What is this overcoming all about? What does it mean to be separate
from the world"?
<p>
What's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Where does this information come from? Does it come
from you?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> (Laughs) We just answered that, but we'll answer it again.
If it comes from me, it comes from the wrong source. It <em>can</em>
come from me. Let me give you an example of how <em>I</em> got
off track this morning. Only today I got off track. I get off
track all the time. We had a recording session this morning and
in my eagerness to get this task done, we've been doing one recording
session a day. And here came a day when I thought, "We have
the staff on hand, we have the crew on hand, and the time...maybe
we can get in two recording sessions, and...." What did I just
say? I said <em>I</em> had the thought maybe we could...Oops, <em><strong>I</strong></em>
had the thought. I can't stop every time a thought comes into
my head and qualify its source by saying, "I talked to Ti
and I asked Ti what Ti thought about this." It's my responsibility
to ask Ti in silence - I'm <em>responsible</em> for that. I'm also
<em>responsible</em> for what comes out of my mouth.
And when it's off track, I'm responsible for that. I'm responsible
to get back on track. I'm responsible to acknowledge the zillions
of times I have acknowledged to these students that I have recognized,
by asking my Older Member, "Was that off track"? and
receiving "Yes, that was a little off track." So, I
say, "Whoops, we were a little off track, so we've got to
get back on track." And this is what we do. We continue
to work against getting off track.
<p>
What I'm saying is I thought, "Well, we could have two
sessions today." Then, after the first session when I was
a little pooped, I went in my privacy for a little while and I
said "Ti, whoops, I forgot to ask you what you thought about
two sessions today." Believe it or not, the funny thing
I felt was that by proceeding with it, which was not at the time
of day that we have been proceeding with sessions, I felt that
Ti and Ti's helpers who were helping us with the session kind
of scurried to get here to help us, and it was like we had trouble
getting going. We had trouble moving in, being good vessels.
It's like my word processor didn't want to work and I was trying
to force things and trying to pull, which wouldn't have happened
had I stopped and said, "Ti, what do you think about our
having an earlier session, and a later session in the same day"?
<p>
Now, I'm just using that as an example. Where does this information
come from? I'm quite capable of giving you misinformation. Wow!
This gets into another issue. If you know my Father, if you
learn that I am devoted to my Father and my Father uses me, and
you can recognize Him through me, then you have to involve yourself
in a position of trust with me - trust in the instrument that
He has appointed or assigned or given - the instrument that now
Ti continues to use. And I am responsible for asking for each
little thing, each little thing all day long, all night long,
each time I slip and don't ask, I catch myself needing to go back
and ask. Now, that's good, it helps develop my habit of better
asking, because I'm sure that you think, "Well I've always
known about asking. 'Ask and you shall receive, seek and ye find.'
I've known those things." But how often do you ask? About
how serious does the question have to be for you to ask it? And
when you ask it, if you don't get an answer, do you go ahead,
or do you wait until you get one? And if you don't get one, then
you assume it's not time for one or this is off base? Now, I'm
not saying before you put the first spoon of your bowl of cereal
in your mouth you have to say, "Older Member, would you have
me put my first spoon of my cereal in my mouth? And then would
you have me put my second spoon of my cereal in my mouth"?
No, that's ridiculous, that's carrying it to an extreme. But
believe it or not, I don't feel it is an extreme to ask my Older
Member, "What do you think about this kind of cereal for
this vehicle, at this "fuel stop," or this meal, this
time to consume? Does that seem okay? If it's something you
wouldn't approve of, I don't want to put it in this vehicle. 
So, if it is not proper, if you don't approve of it, I want to
know about it."
<p>
That's just to try to help you know the degree of asking. These
students have learned that I can forget to ask at times. I can
give misinformation. But, they also know that I continue to go
back and recognize that. And I even hate to say that because
I don't even want to give myself credit for continuing. You know,
I have to mention this one little thing. It's a silly, stupid
little thing that Christians get into debating. "Once saved,
always saved." Nothing could be further from the truth.
I can fall ten times faster than I can rise. It's ten times
easier to fall than it is to climb one step in the right direction.
This is <em>not</em> an easy task - the one of overcoming,
the one of getting into our Father's House, the one of leaving
this world behind.
<p>
I heard over the news about a woman who in recent floods had
lost her house and the furniture in it, and she was distraught.
She said, "You know, these conditions like floods and storms
and rain, I grew up thinking that the Lord brings those things,
and therefore I don't feel bad about it. We'll just reconstruct."
She said, "But I'm not ready to leave and go there. I like
it<strong>;</strong> I still like it here." Big difference in where we sit
and where she sat. I do not mean to criticize her. At least
she acknowledged her Lord. I must admit to you I don't like it
in this human kingdom. I don't like it one iota. It is so dominantly
controlled, it vibrates through and through, <em>everything</em>
that is against our Father's Kingdom because that is what it has
become. In almost another breath, I could say it's almost normal
at the end of an Age when a garden has served as a catalyst of
negative and positive, and some can come out of it and even be
fruit for the Kingdom of Heaven, it's almost a possible commonness
at the end of an Age, for a garden to become this hideous.
<p>
I do not mean to criticize this garden, but even those of you
who still love certain aspects of this garden know how out of
control it has become - in our care of its environment, in
our misuse of the things that have been given to us. We'll talk
about what overcoming is and what some of the specifics are as
we go on with our questions. But I don't like this place. I
like our Father's Kingdom. I was sent here to do a task. I liked
it before my soul really took over this vehicle and awakened.
I liked it a lot, I had a lot of fun. I was very "into"
this world. But now that the soul has taken it over, and my Father
is speaking through it, I can honestly tell you that it's a miserable
existence to be here. I try to make the best of it. I try to
make it as pleasant as possible while I'm here, as pleasant for
the students as it can be made while we're here. We have to do
all kinds of little things to try to make it pleasant. But it's
only because our minds are concentrated on things that are <em>not</em>
of this world. When you are concentrating on things that are
of another world that you are not in, you're left pretty vacant,
except in the lessons and the knowledge of the fact that you're
here for the purpose of overcoming. 
<p>
Now, who's next in our questions?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> We talked about Ages and wondered if this would be an
appropriate time to discuss the three Ages, or are there more
than three Ages?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, I think we mentioned in a session that some Biblical
scholars recognized that in the Bible there are references to
the "Age that was," meaning the period of time prior
to this Earth Age, and the "Age to come," in reference
to another Earth Age. It's important that we discuss this a little
bit. The scientists frequently argue with some "religionists,"
or some religious people who consider themselves creationists.
Some of these creationists have the idea that this Age is how
old the planet is, and that at the end of this Age it's all over.
I don't know if they think the planet is also going to be destroyed,
and I'm not saying the planet isn't. I'm not going to pre-guess
what our Father's Kingdom plans to do with the planet. But, for
sake of understanding, I think it's important that we examine
that this planet has been here a long time.
<p>
I'm afraid that the information that Ti and I have been given
suggests that it has served as a "garden" a number of
times. We don't have any information about there being any other
garden that can serve as that stepping stone for what we call
a "human condition" elsewhere. Even though it seems
so unbelievable that in these vast, vast, vast heavens that there
is not another current garden. I'm not saying there isn't. I
don't know...I simply don't know. But I do feel that the information
that we have been given to understand, certainly at this point,
does suggest that ages such as this period that we consider 6000
years (the duration of a Next Level experiment - a cycle of a
human civilization), where at the beginning was.... Let's say
there was a previous Age and it went through something equivalent
to 6000 years, and those folks, too, had to mess it up. Then
it was time to recycle it because the environment was a mess,
and their clutter was a mess. And I don't know what they'd done
with space junk or if they'd gotten into space. But it was time
to go in, spade up the garden, harvest the yield, and get rid
of the spoils - take the weeds and let them be destroyed, or maybe
even let some space aliens come in and take <em>strong</em> weeds
(weeds from our Father's point of view) at the end of that Age.
The current Age, what we're calling approximately 6000 years,
is pretty much illustrated as beginning at Adam's time, or right
prior to that time. There were some other races that supposedly
were put on the planet right prior to that time. But roughly,
it's still within the framework of that 6000-year period, or Age,
and that means that between now and the end of this decade - and
I'm afraid I feel like we're off a number of years, that it's
going to be significantly before the end of this decade - will
be the end of this Age. So, it's spade time. And the big, big,
big surprise will come.
<p>
What do we mean "a big surprise"? Well, when all that's
out there (Kingdom of God and space aliens) comes in to harvest,
the big question will be how much of that will be witnessed? 
How much of that will take place without those who are running
around on the planet seeing, or knowing, that it will take place?
For example, the possibility arises that some could come and
take souls by the droves and all we would know is vehicles were
dying by the droves, because souls weren't occupying them any
longer. We could call it a plague or a disease, or we don't know.
(And I'm certainly not suggesting because of the AIDS thing that
that's what's happening to AIDS victims. Far from it.) But that's
one way that harvesting could take place that we would not be
able to observe. But it's altogether possible that our Father's
Kingdom, as well as those in Luci's corporation, can come in at
the end of the Age, en masse, and do their taking of those who
they want, though they might likely come in at different times.
<p>
Now, here's a real delicate subject I hate to discuss. But I'm
afraid that our Father's Kingdom is not going to come in.... (Boy!
I can hear Luci shouting at me before I ever get these words out
of my mouth. I'm sorry, "Luci" I said. I hear <em>Satan</em>
shouting at me.) I'm afraid our Father's Kingdom is not going
to come in and have someone looking like the common picture of
Jesus floating down to the planet in flowing garb, showing scars,
and saying, 'I, Jesus, have come to give you peace, and peace
for the world.' I'm afraid our Father's Kingdom desires no peace
for the human kingdom. In our Father's Kingdom can be found peace.
Like we've discussed before, if you caught it, the human kingdom
was not even designed to work. Even though the human kingdom
could have become the Kingdom of our Father, had those who were
created in the human kingdom made all the options to do only His
will, instead of listening to those who were influencing them
to do otherwise.
<p>
So, here at the end of the Age, back to the question "Ages,"
there were probably Ages before this one and before the one before.
I don't have any idea how many Ages this garden has served as
a "graduation" place, or as an "experiential"
garden for the same kind of harvest that we just discussed. I
have no idea how many times after this that this garden will be
used in that way. There's a strong possibility that the garden
may at this time cease to be used further as a garden for the
human kingdom, and might actually become, in a sense, a base for
our Father's Kingdom for a period of time. I don't know how long
the healing process would take, even if this garden were to be
recycled and used as a human level garden again, if it is, in
fact, used as a human garden again. Another hypothesis that we
must consider a little bit is that whatever that new garden is
and when that new Age does arrive after the recycling has sufficiently
occurred to give it a fresh start, then there will be a new "Adam."
"Adam" meant beginning man, the first "plant"
there that was. There will be a new Adam, a new Eve. There will
be a new Satan, of all things, someone to represent that same
negative, to pull your eyes away from our Father's Kingdom. I'm
not saying that that is the way it's going to be. I'm saying,
if our Father intends to use this garden in another planting similar
to this one in the growth pattern that we have seen in this little
Age.
<p>
The reason I brought that up is because a moment ago when I said
that the big surprise could come, that spacecrafts could come
in by the thousands, maybe come in shifts. One shift of spacecrafts
could come in from one part of the Heavens bringing with them
that one who came down with scars and flowing hair and flowing
robes, saying, "Peace on Earth. We're going to solve all
the problems of this world." Don't get me wrong, it wouldn't
be Jesus. It would not be Jesus. It would not be a Representative
from our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
Now, those who had bought into that - and that's what they
believed with all their heart - I'm afraid they're prime targets
to believe him (the counterfeit), and to move into that condition.
And it might even be harder to get out of that "misinformation
corporation" after having <em>left </em>a human garden, than
it was <em>at </em>the human garden, if an opportunity to get out
does come to them later, after having moved into the corporation
outside of the human condition. Don't forget, even that corporation
at its highest peak is still in the human condition and made up
of the misinformation of the opposition. But the only way any
space alien could get into our Father's Kingdom is to come back
into a human civilization (for it is designed to be where overcoming
must take place, where the change of swapping misinformation for
the Truth (the facts) must take place), <em>if</em> as our Father
sees them and reads them on His meter, He says, "There's
enough goodness in there, I want to give them a gift and let them
migrate toward a source of that Truth." Then that overcoming
would have to happen here, in a human civilization.
<p>
But, as far as three Ages are concerned, I don't know why, but
I feel like there were many before this one, not just one. And
as to what follows, I have no idea. It's a strong likelihood
it could be a garden again, with a new Adam, a new Satan. But,
our Father hasn't told me. I don't know what the next plan is.
I know what some of the possibilities might be. Next question,
who's up?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I was wondering if you wanted to talk a little bit about
when people die. Do they go where they think they're going? 
And I've also been having the thought, and I don't know if it's
tied into it or if it's part of your thought, but does that have
anything to do with, and you may have just touched on this, "What
you're bound to on Earth, you're bound to in Heaven"?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay. Do people go where they think they're going? I'm afraid
we did just touch on that, but we'll enlarge on that a little
bit. "What you're bound to on Earth, you're bound to in
Heaven." Absolutely true. I mean, and it didn't come from
Do, it didn't originate with us. Jesus said it, but I'm afraid
it didn't originate with Jesus. It came from our Father's mind,
that what you're bound to on Earth, you're bound to in Heaven.
Now, that's just a way of saying what we just said, that if you
expect to get into our Father's Kingdom, you've got to break the
shackles. You've got to destroy the binds. You've got to rise
above the binds. By your <em>effort</em> you've got to not give
in to the things that would hold you in the human condition, or
in the Earth's grasp, or the vibrations of the human kingdom.
<p>
If anybody loses their vehicle in the world, whatever they were
hooked on - career, family, dope, anything else that they're
hooked on at the time they leave their vehicle - that's what
they're going to <em>be</em> hooked on. Now, you're saying, "Are
they going to Heaven"? They might have just been put on
"ice." They might even be in a discarnate condition
for an extended period of time. I'm not saying that our Father's
Kingdom puts everything on "ice." Our Father's Kingdom
permits, certainly, many, many "discarnate humans" to
remain in the "discarnate" state and <em>serve</em> Luci's
camp - I'm sorry, Lucifer's camp - in a discarnate condition.
But the ones who expect to get to our Father's Kingdom have to
take a vehicle. They have to "get into" that vehicle.
They have to gain <em>complete</em> control of that vehicle, and
they have to acknowledge our Heavenly Father. They have to recognize
that everything they have believed in has been wrong. They have
to <em>want</em> cleansing, purity. They have to <em>want</em> to
rid themselves of their whole way of life, their whole lifestyle,
even (as we've discussed) their "identity," if they
possibly could (which they can't quite do) in order to be received
into His Household. But, if they're in the process of doing that
to the best of their ability - only He can judge the best
of their ability - He will protect them and save them, even if
He had to plant them in another Age, if there's another Age.
<p>
I don't know. We're trying not to take chances. Look, if the
opportunity is here before you to leave this condition, to overcome
this world, why take a chance on being satisfied with just 'being
saved' for a later date? Why not '<em>yield</em>'? Yield? What
does that mean? Turning yourself <em>over</em> to your Heavenly
Father, saying, "I'm putty in Your hands." Lucifer's
camp comes rushing in and says, "See. Brainwashed condition."
And yet if you love our Father, you'd say, "Oh, I hope so.
I <em>hope</em> brainwashed condition." Our Father jumps
in and says, "Nope, unfortunately, can't do that. I'll give
you my mind as long as you continue to seek it - more of it,
and more of it, as you desire it. And I must admit, the more
you have of it, the more we will be alike, and the more commonness
that you will experience (witness) in the other members of the
Household of our Father."
<p>
Lucifer's camp over here thinks they're such "individuals,"
so liberated, and they're not brainwashed. They think they're
going their own way, they're entrepreneurs in everything they
do. Start writing a little chart of what they're into, and then
let's discuss who's "brainwashed," who's under somebody's
spell, who's almost a robot without knowing it, thinking that
they're individual. They're individual in that they may go to
different beauty parlors, and different manicurists, and different
wedding chapels, but they do the same things. Maybe it's Italian
instead of Chinese at the restaurant, or it's Methodist instead
of Presbyterian - they think they're so individual to have those
little differences, when they're no differences at all.
<p>
Ok, let's go to the next question.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> If I'm seeking the Truth, and I really want to know the
Truth, will I find God?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> (Laughs) Of course, the answer is, from where we sit, if
you're seeking the Truth, we have to say, "Our Father is
the Truth." We have to say, "We have found the Truth,"
for we have found our Father. We know the difference now. We
have advanced to the condition of knowing the difference. But
the danger is that there are many, in seeking the "Truth,"
who would arrive at a condition of finding "God," but
it might be the wrong god. A common thing in seeking the "truth"
when you're on the wrong track is to end up with somewhat of an
intellectualized agnostic condition of saying, "Well, I just
can't know the Truth. Therefore, I'll be as good a humanitarian
as I can be. I'll serve my fellow man, and I'll work for charitable
organizations, and I'll be an educator, and I'll learn everything
I can learn." But, you know what? Their behavior and their
indulgences continue to be the same behavior and indulgences of
all those others out there who have not started any program of
overcoming. Now, we can't really blame them for having not started
a program of overcoming, because, unfortunately, there's that
ingredient that exists, that our Father's Kingdom says, "I
have to send you a Rep. I have to send somebody <em>representing</em>
the Kingdom of Heaven that will take you through that overcoming.
And that's their responsibility - to take you through it."
And we'll talk about that more. Did that answer your question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Yes.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> State your question one more time.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I wanted to know if I look for the "Truth,"
and I really want to know it, will the end result be finding God?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, certainly from our point of view, yes. From <em>most</em>
of the departments in Lucifer's corporation, you will find "cosmic
consciousness," or "universal mind," "liberated
spirit" - unrealistic fantasies of going to other worlds
in out-of-body experiences. I don't want to start condemning
religions, but, you know, there's something we have to return
to here, and that is that our Father's Truth is not a religion.
It's simply the facts. Simply the way it is - it's the facts.
Once we even begin to label it "religion" we are already,
at that point, a significant degree away from the facts, the Truth.
So, then the question comes up, "If that's the case, then
what church is it that's going to get in"? Well, what does
the word "church" mean? "Church" is a body of believers.
There's no special denomination or religion that has a foothold,
or that's going to get the door open to them where the others aren't.
Even though I must admit that our Father's Kingdom did, in its
teaching process in this particular Age, relate more directly with the
Jewish experience as recorded in the Old Testament of our Bible, and
in the relationship of Jesus with His disciples, and the other records
that are shown in the New Testament of the Bible. That is still the
most accurate account of our Father's Kingdom's relationship to humans
in this Earth Age.
<p>
But, you out there, I'm sure the question could come into your
mind, "Well then, what am I to do about my present church?
You know, my folks are Catholic, or they're Methodist, or they're
this, or that. Does that mean I just throw that away"? 
Do you throw away any good stepping stone? You consider thanksgiving
for that stepping stone. You don't condemn anyone who is on that
stepping stone<strong>;</strong> you <em>praise</em> them, particularly if they just
moved into that stepping stone from one that was <em>less</em> like
our Father's Kingdom in behavior and in concept. And you think,
well, at least they're trying to get closer. But, as we think
of prophesy and the end times, we have to think of the true Church.
The true Church is a body of believers that know the Truth - just
a group of individuals that know the Truth (know the facts). 
That's kind of a funny term because they know a little bit of
the Truth, and they come more into the Truth, and they come more
into the Truth, and they come more into the Truth, as they fight
off the untruth, fight off the untruth, and shed it.
<p>
In our classroom situation and the overcoming that these students
have been through, they've been through hell. If there ever was
a hell, they've been through it. If there ever was a purgatory,
they've been through it. And I'm sure they can't count the number
of times that they doubted everything, and they wondered, "What
on Earth am I doing"? Then there were times when they would
come and say, "I did this, and I'm sure it was <em>very</em>
offensive to the Kingdom of Heaven, and to you and Ti, and anybody
representing the Kingdom of Heaven. You've got to help me get
control of it. You've got to help me get past it."
<p>
And that is the process of growth. That is the process of overcoming.
Recognizing that you've slipped. Recognizing that your behavior
has been a little less than it should have been, and you see it
now as worse than "a little less" and you find it intolerable.
And so you have to - what's the pattern? - Ask. You have to
come back, put it in front of your teachers and say, "I hate
to admit this, but I did this, and I don't want to do it anymore.
Will you help me? I know I can get past it." Then the
teacher says to the Older Member, "You heard what they just
said. Can we help them? Do you want to help them"? And
so the information comes. It may not come right on the spot.
It may cause them to wonder for a period of time, "Why am
I not getting help"? They may even in the meantime fall
again, and by falling again, then they hurt even <em>more</em>,
because they want to overcome. And they're moving closer as they're
in that process.
<p>
I know that we have not gotten into the specifics of what separating
from the world is - what overcoming the world is. We've talked
about it a lot, but we haven't gotten into any significant amount
of the specifics, and we're right next to the end of today's session.
We will get into those specifics in our next session, because
it's time. I want to end this session with asking that you, as
an observer of these tapes, I want to suggest, if you want to,
that you go and find a private spot and reach as high as you can
reach and say, "What direction should I take? I don't want
to be misled. I don't want to be led <em>away</em> from You. I
want to find my God." It's safer looking for your Heavenly
Father than it is to look for Truth, even though they are the
same thing. We'll see you in the next session.
