<strong>
Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 9
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr>

Here we are again, and this is our ninth session. I'm going
to ask the camera behind me to let you see our helpers today.
<p>
Well, in an earlier session I believe I explained to you that
we got up early, early, early in the morning, while everyone happened
to be in the same place because we had a holiday, and we were
visiting, and we had a little lesson which I don't need to get
into, because I went over it with you at that time. But here's
another little illustration that I want to share with you.
<p>
In the quarters where I spent last night, I seemed to sleep only
a very short time, not that it's that unusual. I don't seem to
require that much sleep, which is fine. But from about 1<strong>:</strong>30 on,
it was as if I wanted to stay in communication with Ti and wanted
to see if there was anything we needed to alter, or anything I
needed to particularly be aware of that I was not aware of in
our sessions. And one point that came in so clearly that was
new to me, in a sense, because we hadn't discussed it in the sessions,
was that really these sessions are for this classroom. In other
words, they're for the <em>students</em>. I feel I have instruction
that Ti is helping me - hopefully speaking through me 
- and so on up the pipeline - it's almost as if I have instructions
to make these tapes of these sessions for the purposes that the
students will have use of if this task continues.
<p>
And so it puts the focus on a little different point, because
it's up to them. They don't have clear-cut instructions on what
to do with these tapes or these sessions, and we don't make those
instructions up. We do a step at a time. I think I've mentioned
to you before that very often instructions just come a step at
a time, and then we wait for the next one. But we do whatever
we <em>have</em> received. And we did receive instructions to try
this method of operation here to see if it would work for the
teacher to make tapes with the students trying to help with the
picture and asking some questions. And, it seemed that our Older
Member was coming in to those sessions and helping us with information,
and it was <em>working</em>. It seemed we were being used as instruments
for their information. And as soon as it seemed to flow as well
as it did, even though we know that that could change at any time,
then we've just been going on with it. It's been hard to stop.
We've almost wanted to not miss a day without doing a Session
or two, as long as we felt like we were still getting information
to go further.
<p>
But I want to make the point a little bit more clearly that these
sessions and these tapes are, in a sense, teaching tools for the
students - to get that idea a little more clearly in our
heads. In other words, my relationship with you in a sense is
symbolic, and in a sense it isn't. If this task proceeds, my
relationship with you might end up being more as grandfather to
grandson, and these students might serve more in the capacity
as teacher since they are <em>older</em> than you. I don't know
if that has clarified in your mind, but it might have if other
things that we have said had added up at this time. If they have
completed sufficient overcoming of their own in this task, and
they received instruction to put the information out, even though
the way that instruction came was to do it in this method, then
they are in a real sense going to serve in the teacher role with
you, or in a sense, in the "midwifing" or the father
relationship, if you don't use that as a <em>spiritual</em> term.
In other words, if they have completed enough overcoming that
they could move <em>right now</em> into our Father's Kingdom, and
even move into a physical vehicle of our Father's Kingdom, no
longer occupying the vehicle they are in, whether this one or
the one that they're in is changed over into that new vehicle
or another one altogether, then they don't need to come back to
the human kingdom unless sent. That's the instruction we have
received - that that's the case.
<p>
So, here's another one of those days where you're put to the
test by things that we say, because this could be hard to make
a mental adjustment to. Each time we arrive at a <em>threshold</em>
of a major move forward, it always tests us. And it usually tests
us as "I'm not sure I can buy that." But if you examine
things, and the next thing you know you say, "Well, it makes
<em>sense</em>. I'll just have to see. I'll just have to play
it a step at time." And that's the way you should, just
simply a step at a time, and <em>checking</em>, just as we check.
And you check with <em>your</em> Heavenly Father. You check with
your <em>connection</em>, and see if we have the same one. If we
don't have the same connection, then that's a clear indication
that it's time for you to cease in this process of letting us
serve as the instruments to help you get this picture and get
this information that we have instruction to share with you.
<p>
Well, we're going to proceed with our questions, and I'm going
to ask this student what's first on her list of questions?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I wanted to see if you felt like you wanted to
say more about the terms "God," "Lord," and
"Older Member"?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes, I feel that we should. That's a very misunderstood issue.
Humans have a lot of misunderstandings about the term "God."
So much so that some, without really stopping and thinking about
the implications of it, think, "Well, there's only <em>one</em>
God and everything in the Heavens is God's, so there must be only
one Creature there." And yet they also think that people,
when they die, go there. So, how can there only...? Oh well,
it gets kind of confusing. And the term "God," the
English term "God" - unfortunately in the translation
from the manuscripts of the Bible there were different terms used.
The English translators kind of lumped them all into one and
used "God," no matter which Hebrew name was used. All
these names <em>really meant</em> a member of the Kingdom of Heaven
who was assigned a particular task "relating" to the
humans. So, if you look at manuscripts and see the <em>different</em>
names that were applied, some might think, "Well, that's
talking about the different characteristics of this <em>one</em>
Person." And they don't stop to think that the "<em>Chief
of Chiefs</em>" or the "<em>God of Gods</em>," the
<em>Almighty</em>, the <em>Most High</em> <em>God</em>, the <em>Creator</em>
in the Kingdom of Heaven, can assign some from His membership
to assist Him in tending to the garden, certainly in elementary
tasks or tasks that would be elementary to the Creator. And that
doesn't mean that <em>they</em> have not even learned how to create,
in a garden circumstance.
<p>
For sake of clarity and understanding, it would help your head,
as it has helped us to understand, as it has been given to us,
that the different members of the Kingdom of Heaven who were assigned
to relate to the humans in this Age, depending upon the task that
was their assignment, ended up with a different "title."
And it was more of a <em>title</em> than it was a name. If you
know much about the history in Hebrew as it relates to the name
that applies to members of our Father's Kingdom, there is some
discussion that those names were never to be pronounced and never
to be spoken. Some even don't write them except maybe a consonant
to start it and then a dash and maybe another consonant to end
it. There have been all kinds of theological discussions through
the years about the "tabooness" of humans being able
to call the names, or to not really know the names.
<p>
So, the humans were given <em>titles</em> to use for different
members of the Kingdom of Heaven that illustrated their task assignments.
And like I say, those titles were reduced to just a single title
in the translation to English. So, the title "God"
is just kind of like a general "over-title," because
there were others that were given depending on the task that the
member was assigned to by the Creator (or whichever subordinate
member assigned that individual) - to work directly with the humans,
whether it be with Adam and Eve in the Garden or those in the
desert or in Egypt or in Israel. So, don't be confused by these
terms. These are simply titles. Now those titles <em>should</em>
receive tremendous respect from the humans, because in a sense
it is a <em>human</em> relating to a member of the Kingdom of Heaven.
And the members of the Kingdom of Heaven wouldn't be relating
to them if the information was worthless or if they were simply
humans just relating to them in <em>human</em> matters. Those members
are relating to humans, trying to help them get mindful of the
Truth, the reality that the Kingdom of Heaven exists, that they
are "plants" that were made by the Kingdom of Heaven,
and if they follow the instruction and behavior from the Kingdom
of Heaven, then they can learn to actually <em>aspire</em> to be
members of the Kingdom of Heaven.
<p>
Now, Jesus, in His relationship with His disciples, some of them
called Him "Lord," and some called Him "Rabbi"
or called Him "Teacher" or called Him "Jesus."
And from our point of view, I believe that probably from <em>their</em>
reference point that "Teacher" was the most applicable
term, and that "Lord" probably meant more in its original
meaning, as reference to a member of Our Father's Kingdom, or
someone who is above you in the step of growth, the step of elevation,
or closer to God. Even in humans' kingdoms, where they have a
monarchy (a king or a queen), they use the term "lords"
for people in positions of authority and who have higher tasks
in the structure of that kingdom government. And when in the
Bible they use the terms <em>Kingdom</em>, it's because the illustration
of a <em>King</em> and the relationship of the <em>subjects</em> to
the <em>King,</em> is very much like a hierarchy of authority in
the Kingdom of Heaven. The illustration works, the analogy works.
It's very like some of the structures that have been translated
into the human kingdom, as they had king and queen and subjects
and lords and parliament houses and so forth. We'll discuss a
little bit more of that issue the further we go.
<p>
Now, a very objective term that we have been given to try to
help our understanding, and as far as I know, I don't know of
a synonym in the translation of the Hebrew...well I take that
back. There are synonyms both in the Hebrew and the Greek that
relate to someone who has gone further on the ladder in getting
closer to the Chief of Chiefs, or closer to our Father's Kingdom,
as <em>Older.</em> And also if they're members of our Father's
Kingdom, then we can put those together and they're an <em>Older
Member</em>. And we talk constantly about Older Members in relating
as a point of reference from one member to another one, a <em>Younger
Member,</em> an <em>Older Member. </em> Because that's perfectly
synonymous with son, father, grandfather - <em>Younger Member,
Older Member, Older Member's Older Member. </em>And in the same
way, in the <em>Kingdom</em> of Heaven as a <em>kingdom</em> with
a <em>king</em> and subjects, the subjects have a structure that
could also be referred to in an analogy of families. For example,
in a partnership, there can be, if you use it in the right sense,
a husband and wife, or a marriage, because there is a committal.
Not husband and wife in the male/female sense, but "marriage"
for <em>committal</em> in a partnership where there may not usually
be that much age difference or it might be the <em>connecting</em>
age difference. So, these are kind of used interchangeably where
even these students, for example, see me as an <em>Older Member</em><strong>;</strong>
I see them as <em>younger members</em>, in the sense that they are
committed to the Kingdom of Heaven and have to also accept the
Representative in that committal. They have only one Representative.
They don't have much choice, at least for the moment we haven't
found much choice to give them. So, in a sense they have that
same committal they make to the Kingdom of Heaven, with the Representative
that was given. And that not only are they younger members to
Older Members, but that committal almost becomes like a "marriage,"
if you can take it out of the male/female relationship context.
<p>
It's very interesting to think of those terms, because historically
in the manuscripts, as they relate to our Father's Kingdom and
its relationship to the humans, certainly in this Age that we
know about (we don't know much about the other Ages), these synonyms
work - even though through the Ages they've become kind of
"Old English" or kind of "religiousized,"
or we make them something less than objective, less than true,
by making them very spiritual terms. And that's the reason that
our instruction has been that <em>Teacher</em> is certainly a good
and appropriate term. <em>Older Member</em> is certainly a good
<em>objective</em> term. We can use that better. We get <em>un</em>comfortable
when they use the term <em>Father,</em> certainly in speaking to
me, even though I'm serving in that capacity. But students don't
use that term in relating to me because it gives me the jitters,
because it kind of brings in the possible religiosity of that
terminology. Even though ever since we've begun these sessions,
we're talking to you about our <em>Heavenly</em> <em>Father</em>,
and even though I realize that Ti is my <em>Older Member</em>, in
a sense synonymous with a <em>Father</em> to me, since it's <em>Older
</em>Member. In a realistic sense, these are my children. Remember
how you get "birthed" into the Kingdom of Heaven? Babies
in the Kingdom of Heaven come from adults from the human kingdom,
so if these are babies that have come from the human kingdom entering
the Kingdom of Heaven, and I am assigned the role of "midwifing,"
then these are my children, I am their Father. But I still get
uncomfortable with it, and we don't use the term relating to me
as <em>Father</em>, certainly not <em>Lord</em>, certainly not <em>God</em>,
certainly not <em>Heavenly Father</em>. We reserve that kind of
terminology for those who are outside of human vehicles and <em>in</em>
vehicles that would be the <em>natural</em> vehicle for our Father's
Kingdom.
<p>
Okay, lets go to the next question, or was there more to that
question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I might be wrong, but it seems like you covered
it.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, what's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Talking about terms, there are lots of interpretations
to the word <em>sin</em> and I'm wondering if you could help us
by giving us the real meaning of sin and if there's any validity
to karma.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, you put me on the spot when you said, "Will you
give us the real meaning of the word <em>sin</em>." I'll do
the best I can and hope that it's Ti who is feeding me because
I certainly trust the position that Ti happens to be in right
now and her relationship with our Older Member. <em>Sin</em>, sin.
Karma certainly is in this picture - "karma" meaning
a term that a lot of Eastern religions use, and we'll discuss
that in a moment. But let's talk about sin. Sin is anything,
any behavior, any act - "act" meaning a thought,
any conduct - anything that I do that puts space between me and
God, or between me and the Kingdom of Heaven, between me and the
Representative, between me and goodness. Anytime the part of
the mind that's in my soul gets its way, and it's not of that
majority side that is mind that has been given to me from our
Father's Kingdom, then it is <em>sin</em>. It is information that
came from the wrong side of the tracks, that is not true. It
is misinformation. It is designed to convert me to the ways of
the world or to put me in opposition to my Father's Kingdom and
to prevent me from overcoming the world and getting to my Father's
Kingdom. That is <em>sin</em>. And you can't talk about sin without
talking about death. I'm sure all of you know the little scripture,
"The wages of sin are death." Now we've talked about
how death doesn't mean losing a vehicle. Death means losing the
<em>soul</em>. So, if my soul shrinks and deteriorates and goes
further and further away from the Kingdom of Heaven by each act
of sin, or each act of the world, or each act of misinformation
that I do, then I'm getting closer and closer to death. Because
death is when that mind of God that was in my soul has shrunk
so that our Father's Kingdom would judge it non-redeemable, <em>non-redeemable</em>,
it can't be reversed. It's gone<strong>;</strong> by its own choices it has gone
to the point of being nonexistent. There's not enough good stuff
in there to even make it register.
<p>
Let's be sure that you understand that certainly in the position
in the task that we're involved in, we don't do any judging, and
we are not the ones who would be in a position like that. But
it's very important that you, as a possible student, understand
how behavior adds up.
<p>
Before we go any further with that, let's skip to this Eastern
idea of <em>karma</em> and the idea that I have to pay for my sins
- and this doesn't just apply to the Eastern idea of <em>karma</em>.
The truth as it relates to us in the manuscripts is that we pay
for our sin, and the wages of sin are death. So, if I continue
in the path of sin, I'm going to lose my soul, I'm going to reach
death. In a sense, each act of sin that I do is going to take
hard work and labor to recover from. If I become an alcoholic,
it becomes <em>labor</em> to rise above, <em>really</em> rise above
alcoholism. And we're just using that as an example of anything
that I would overcome in the process of getting out of the sin
that I got into. What's the little saying, that whatever you're
bound to on Earth, you're bound to in Heaven? Now, that was using
the term "Heaven" to kind of throw several things into
one grouping, one terminology, just like "God" is a
general term that means a number of different things. "Heaven"
also means a bunch of different things to different people. Like
"Heaven" was used and is used as a term of where you
go when you lose your vehicle. And that may or may not be so,
certainly from someone else's point of view. Of course, a lot
of people who say, "Heaven is where you go when you lose
your vehicle," also say, "If you don't go there, then
you go to hell." And "hell," of course, also means
different things to different understandings, depending upon how
much misinformation you have or how much knowledge you have, or
how much closer your information is to the truth, or how you've
grown on the ladder of getting closer to our Father's Kingdom.
Because that's where that truth comes in - a little bit,
little bit at a time. Okay, Heaven and hell, and what happens
in between.
<p>
Give me that again because I got off the track and I want to get
right back to the particulars of where we were.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Yes, I asked what about sin and does karma have any validity?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, let's get back to the karma idea. Thank you. The idea
of karma is that I pay for any misdeed I have done. In other
words, some of the Eastern religions who believe in the idea of
karma believe that, "If I kill somebody, then I'm going to
be killed. That same thing is going to come back to me. If I
murder somebody, I'm going to be murdered. If I treat somebody
ill, I'm going to be treated in the same way." And that's
a very close translation. Don't forget, a counterfeit is always
very close to the truth. Karma is a counterfeit. Some of what
it says is true. Other aspects that it says are not true. Where
it becomes untrue is that in our Father's Kingdom our Father can
send a Representative to <em>accelerate</em> your possibilities
of getting closer to the Kingdom of Heaven. And that Representative,
or that individual from that Kingdom, when they involve themselves
in your task of overcoming and they assist you in that, they can
from an Eastern point of view, or the karma point of view, they
can take your karma. Our Father's House's interpretation of that
same idea says, "I can take your sin, I can relieve you of
your sin." When Jesus said to his disciples that, 'If you
truly ask forgiveness, I'll take your case to my Father, I'll
represent you to my Father, I'll see what my Father says, and
if my Father says it's O.K., you're truly sorry that you did it
and you want a fresh start, you want to start over again, then
who am I to say...because I'll certainly give you that chance
to start over again.' In a sense, then, you would not pay for
the sin that you did if you have someone who can take that from
you. Now, it has to be a Representative of our Father's Kingdom,
as Jesus was, who can take that from you and take it on themselves.
In other words, it was a debt that you had. You did a bunch
of wrongs and they add up. Every time you do a behavior against
our Father's Kingdom, it starts totaling up on a column and the
column can get pretty big. It can get pretty terrible. And if
you had to pay them off, I don't know how many Ages it would take
for you to get them all paid off.
<p>
But this is also where "time shortened" comes in and
where, as our Father's Kingdom relates to some who are overcoming
the world, that debt gets relieved or it gets dismissed. But
not altogether, according to the rules that existed in a number
of stages of this particular Earth Age. Now, what I mean is it
didn't get relieved altogether. And here's where Christians traditionally
theologically interpret that Jesus paid it all for you. 'By His
blood were ye redeemed.' In a lot of sense of the word, that's
absolutely true, and we'll talk about that for a moment. Because
He said to His disciples, who were actually physically, personally
relating to Him, and as they did things that were against His
instruction in their overcoming and they recognized it, they acknowledged
it, they asked forgiveness for it, and He said, 'I'll take it,'
and He took it. By taking that debt, He's got a bunch of notes
He's holding here. They were your notes, and now they're His
notes. And I'm not saying it still isn't the case, we don't know.
We'll talk about this in a second. But for a long time in our Father's
Kingdom, the process was, or a decision from the "Parliament"
in the Kingdom, we'll say, or from the "Supreme Court"
in our Father's Kingdom, said that those notes have to be paid,
somebody's got to pay those notes, those notes of sin. So, if
I've committed a bunch of sins and somebody takes my note and
relieves me of it and washes me clean and gives me a fresh start,
then that somebody who took those notes has to pay for that.
And if my total sin certainly amounted to the probability of death
had I not had someone to dump it on, I would have "died,"
I would have lost my soul. And that was the case. Had those
souls that Jesus was dealing with, not known Him.... They
got some help in being directed to Him, but it also required work
of them to pursue Him, to <em>believe</em> Him, to fight off the
influences and the doubt that the world gave them. It would have
been a lot easier for them to say, "Boy, it's getting too
hot around here. People are hunting for Him and they're going
to be hunting for me soon. I think I want to go back and play
it safe." I mean it would have been real easy for them to
stop in their process, because they could have easily said, "Well
I just can't believe that He's who He really says He is. We don't
have any evidence of this." I mean, that happened. He lost
them<strong>;</strong> He lost many who were in line for entering our Father's
Kingdom as sheep of His fold or as students of Him as a Teacher.
<p>
Now we'll go back to where we were. If death is the wages of
sin, and these who came to Him brought their tally to Him, He
took their pink slips, or their notes of indebtedness, and then
He had to pay for it in death...and He did. You heard me in
an earlier tape (and I hope that you paid close attention) when
I said that whether or not He died on the cross, literally diagnosed
by a doctor (had there been an advanced doctor present), and rose
from the dead, that to base your belief of knowledge from our
Father's Kingdom on that one act, and say, "If it wasn't
so, then it's all a farce," and we said, "That's ridiculous."
We also said that it didn't matter to us whether that act was
staged symbolically or whether it was real. But here's another
possibility, and we're speculating, that the act could have been
very real, had the law still been on the books in the "Supreme
Court" as it was handed down, that those debts had to be
paid. And if their debts equaled death, then it could also mean
that since Jesus took them on, the only way He could pay them
was to go through having the sinners (those who were against Him),
who were adding up their own tally of the <em>same</em> sins, be
the ones who then initiated that death. In other words, they
were then used to pay the debt for those who were His students,
who gave their debt to Him and He wiped them clean. And He was
willing to do that.
<p>
Now, our Father's Kingdom is alive and well and "Parliament"
is still in session and has not ended. It still makes decisions
and it still relates to the Chief of Chiefs. The Kingdom exists.
The King is still on His throne. The whole thing works. As
to whether or not that same parallel would have to be drawn today
if a Representative took those sins, or those notes of old debt
of sin, whether they would tally death, we don't know. Or whether
the law has come down in specific cases, because it's always judged
according to the specific case - it's not prejudged in that respect.
Oh, it is prejudged, unless it has been changed. But anytime
that something tests it, then you go and check the books and you
see if that is still what's on the books, and if it is on the
books, then that is what happens. We don't know what's on the
books today. We don't know, for example, if that kind of thing
would have to happen to this vehicle, if I would have to lose
it in that way because of my relationship with these students,
or what would happen to their vehicles as they relate to you if
you continue in the direction that you're going and they continue
in the direction of possibly serving as Older Member or Teacher
as they relate to you.
<p>
Boy, this requires that you travel fast, doesn't it? We don't
know what's "on the books." And we don't guess it.
As we have said before, we are not into any martyr trip. We
don't like that. It's unnatural. It should not be. It was not
designed for anyone to like martyrdom, or to think that they get
spiritual elevation by it, which could be a mistranslation (or
counterfeit information) of what happened at a death which paid
a debt, and then therefore freed the one who paid it and went
on up. And it's true if people say Jesus didn't owe that debt.
Those sins weren't His - even though at one time He had gone
through that same process that they were going through a long
time ago. Because that's the way, don't forget, that children
get into our Father's Kingdom, and certainly Jesus was one who
got into our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
Now exactly what the lesson plans were, and the particulars about
graduation at the time that Jesus graduated into our Father's
Kingdom from a human kingdom, or a human-kingdom equivalent, we
don't know because we don't have that information available to
us. Don't forget that we have also talked about how every individual
on this planet in this Age could have been a <em>created</em> individual
instead of one born of sin. I'm afraid that's true. That is
sin. That is a condition that was brought to them from a kingdom
below. It was an animal condition. It was not intended for human.
Even though a human was designed to have the capability of doing
that act and they had the option to do it, but they have to look
away from their relationship with the One assigned to them by
the Kingdom of Heaven in order to participate in that act.
<p>
Now, the reason I'm bringing that back up is because Jesus could
have graduated in a class or from an Age where that didn't happen,
whether that's only theoretical and did or did not take place
is unimportant. The fact is that the kingdom of man, the kingdom
of human, is designed to go both ways. And by choice in this
Age that we know from our history books - our history books
being primarily the one history book (the Bible) that most of
the public questions the most as to whether or not it's an authentic
history book, the one that does actually tell about God's, our
Heavenly Father's, our Creator's relationship with man, is the
one that the deceived questioned the most as to whether or not
it is an authentic record or if it is a collection of some spiritual
documents or legends, and yet it is <em>the only</em> record of
events. There's a lot in there that you could quibble over.
For example, punctuation that means a lot in your understanding
of things, and yet for the most part, the Biblical scriptures
have no punctuation, so you don't know where one sentence ends
and the next one begins, and it could have a lot of different
meanings. So, how much of it that man altered, because of misinformation,
since that's where Satan camped the most to give misinformation
to those who were the rightful heirs of our Father's Kingdom...it
gets pretty sticky doesn't it?
<p>
Okay, we might have gone enough on that course to have you understand
that. But it is so important to understand that our Father's
Kingdom is alive and well. There is still a group, or there are
still individuals that serve in the capacity of the "Court,"
making decisions about what to do about this case. Sin still
adds up, and can add up to such a great total that there's not
enough of our Father's mind left in there to account for anything...it's
impossible for it to be salvaged.
Therefore, even at that point then, it
becomes a positive because it is recycled. <em>No child of God
is lost</em>. And make no doubt about that. But our Father's
Kingdom has the right to do that, to recycle what has become so
poor. I mean that's what's going to happen. I don't want to
sound like a prophet, but here at the end of the Age, this is
what becomes such an important issue, because things get very
critical at the end of the Age. I know I'm going to throw my
teleprompters off here by skipping to that for a moment. You
know, humans could say, "This all sounds good and well, but
I don't see any evidence. And I could go to the history books
and I can't see that this is really...." No, because
there are no manuscripts of what happened specifically at the
end of the last Age. Therefore, great swarms of members of our
Father's Kingdom, plus from the counterfeit kingdom, could come
in at the end of the Age and take their part of the harvest of
whatever was, in a sense, matched with them, because of what the
soul had become at that point. And Luci's kingdom wants souls.
He wants them more than our Father's Kingdom. That's kind of
hard to understand, but Luci's kingdom <em>needs</em> them. I mean,
he needs them desperately as he works against our Father's Kingdom.
Our Father's Kingdom wants them because they are His creation
that He wants to be able to receive the inheritance of <em>Sonship</em>
in his Kingdom. But believe it or not, our Father's Kingdom does
not need those souls. Our Father's Kingdom can get along fine
without them. He's not out recruiting them because He needs them
for an army to work against Satan. Nope! Different altogether.
Our Father's Kingdom does not <em>need</em> them. Our Father's
Kingdom is all-sufficient. All, for our sake, all-involved in
being a benefactor, all-involved in trying to help those with
potential to receive their potential, not concerned with building
an army. I mean it's certainly true that our Father is so pleased
and excited, and nothing could make Him happier than to have graduates
into His Kingdom, new children, new grandchildren, new great,
great, great, great, great, great, great, grandchildren, if you're
talking in relationship to the Creator. And it's important that
we understand that.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Would you like to talk about the domesticated animals'
relationship to human, and is that a usable parallel?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, I'm glad you brought that up because I think that we
should discuss that. And this is going to test some others because
we'll have to use terminology that you might have been taught
by certain traditional backgrounds to be turned off about. And
we have discussed this slightly. I'm afraid we can't discuss
this without also discussing the appropriate usage of terms like
"creation" and "evolution." And I'm not talking
in terms of Darwinism. But just because Darwin existed doesn't
mean that things don't evolve and we are prohibited from using
the term <em>evolving</em> or thereby using it as "evolution."
Our Father's Kingdom has designed a lot of things within the
framework of His creation that evolve. And yet where He does
not want things to evolve, He takes out a link in the chain so
that it can't evolve beyond that. I mean, there will be a missing
link so that there's no evolvement beyond that. Or He might permit
certain things to evolve and others not to evolve, or vehicles
not to evolve but some souls to evolve. So, in that usage, again
I say not in the typical Darwinian usage, in the usage that the
design of creation also involves evolving, which is <em>beautiful</em>
if you think of it in the right way. I mean, as you look at the
various degrees of souls that you might be acquainted with on
this planet, at their various stages of growth you see things
evolving away from the truth, away from our Heavenly Father.
And at times they evolve closer. You see it happening in religious
groups, or families, nations, or anything. They are either getting
more corruptible and more perishable, or less corruptible and
less perishable.
<p>
Back to her question. Let's talk about the illustration of the
domesticated animal in its relationship to the human kingdom and
use it as an illustration or parallel to a human who's trying
to get into the Heavens, or into our Father's Kingdom. When a
domesticated animal doesn't like to act like an animal, doesn't
even identify with being an animal, it only cares to please its
master, which is the case in different nations with different
animals. For the most part in this nation, or in the U.S., it's
the dog, or in some instances the cat. The thing that identifies,
that we use as our analogy here, is when all that that little
animal wants is to please, and it just runs around wanting an
indication of, "Am I pleasing? Am I pleasing"? and
is just waiting for one moment of attention from that human, and
he doesn't like to run with the dogs. I mean, if it has truly
evolved, it doesn't want to run with the pack. And I have to
bring up another issue here that might touch your funny bone in
one way or the other. I can remember hearing some animal rights
people who were concerned with the overpopulation of animals in
the world and they talk about this "have your pets spayed
or neutered." That's one of the <em>kindest</em> things that
could happen to that dog or that pet. Because then that gives
added help to that little pet to be more preoccupied with service,
more preoccupied with pleasing, more preoccupied with, "What
can I do"? Now, a lot of times, that's where it kind of
separates certain dogs, who want to be petted and that's about
as far as their service gets, from others whose service can extend
beyond that, where they yield very quickly or easily for a training
that can even find them as seeing eye dogs or hearing dogs, or
where they are trained to do a lot of tasks. And I think this
happens certainly in some countries with development in the monkeys
or the chimpanzees. I don't know all the types of domesticated
animals that are trying to please the human kingdom. Unfortunately
the same ratio happens, that the more difficult the transition
is, or the more of a requirement there is, in other words, the
stiffer the task is of trying to assist in real service to the
human kingdom, the more it weeds out a lot of the dogs, or whatever
the domesticated animal might be that really shows a conscious
desire for approval and to serve.
<p>
It's the same way for a human who's trying to overcome his humanness
and not associate with humans and wants only to be a member of
our Father's Kingdom and would even crave to be "spayed"
or "neutered." Remembering in generations past even
some of those Essene communities that we've talked about did do
neutering of their sexuality in order to get closer to their Heavenly
Father. And Jesus certainly knew of that when he gave the little
illustration of some become eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom
of Heaven, 'some become eunuchs because others have made them
eunuchs - some make themselves eunuchs in order to serve the Kingdom
of Heaven.' So, if you read that carefully within its context,
you see how that exists. There's a very strong parallel. And
at this point we have to switch into another gear as we talk about
this domesticated relationship of the animal to the human or the
human to our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
We have to talk more in terms of a soul than a vehicle. (I'm
not saying this is true, and we don't teach it as truth. We have
examined it because it was given to us to examine, and it seems
likely, and we certainly wouldn't be disturbed if that's the way
it happens.)
If you just understand that the most likely scenario
is that the spirit of a domesticated animal that wanted
only to please and was willing
to go to "X" step, at some point it received its reward
and got to move in as a beginner in the human kingdom. And we
don't know what all the rules were as to who got to move into
the human kingdom - what <em>spirits</em> got to move into the human
kingdom. At that point, then, this thing that we call <em>soul
</em>and identify as a package for mind that comes from two sources,
even the rightful application of the word <em>soul</em> comes into
existence for the first time. Needless to say, the dog wasn't
able to talk to his neighbor dog about his soul. That wasn't
in his vocabulary. Only upon reaching into the human kingdom
does even that word processor become a part of his potential,
and to his brain and his understanding, so in that sense of the
word, then, "soul" began in the human kingdom. Though
there was still something that could have certainly come from
that devoted creature, that life force that wanted to move up,
that wanted not to be like the other creatures in <em>his</em> kingdom
but wanted to associate with <em>that</em> human kingdom. And it
helps you get this picture if you can accept that illustration.
Whether the illustration is that accurate or not is relatively
unimportant, though it seems likely that it might be.
<p>
Okay, I was going to go to a later question but think for the
moment we'll stick to our pattern here. Was that her question?
Okay, what's next on <em>your</em> list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> I wondered if you wanted to go back to the topic we
were discussing at the end of the last tape on possessions and
indebtedness and charge cards, and perhaps not leaving a mess
behind.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, we have to because we just barely got started on that,
and that's such an important issue. I'm trying to recall, since
we have made Sessions 6 and 7, wasn't it? Or 7 and 8? We've
made 7 and 8 twice and it's hard to be clear as to how much was
covered. You know, I've got to stop here and remind you that
we've talked about how lessons are hard for us, and the reason
they're hard for us is because it drives it home. And the lesson
I <em>learned</em> that caused us to have to redo the tapes has
side issues, like the one I'm speaking of now. It makes it hard
for me to remember, and being hard for me to remember <em>helps</em>
me not forget that lesson, if I apply it in that way.
<p>
Okay, to go back to the topic, it'll be funny if just about the
time we get back to the topic, we see the little card. We haven't
seen it yet. Okay, here we go.
<p>
If you know your religious manuscripts, if you know the Judeo-Christian
literature, you know that a number of times in that material,
it speaks of the value of man's relationship to possessions and
money and indebtedness. If someone borrows something from you,
if they need to borrow it from you, if you have it and they need
it, and it's valuable to them, from Our Father's point of view,
then, you give it, and if they pay it back, fine<strong>;</strong> if they don't,
you forget about it. Needless to say, that's not the way it is
in this world. And that's not really nearly as important an issue
as the issue that has gotten so totally out of sync with our Father's
Kingdom, and that is <em>indebtedness</em>. In the human world
out there today, everyone owes for everything, and that is <em>totally
</em>contrary to our Father's Kingdom. According to our Father's
Kingdom, you should not have use of anything that did not come
your way rightfully. It is improper to go out and borrow money,
then get something and put it into use, and then you owe for it,
and frequently by the time you've paid for it, it's worthless.
So, then what do you do? You borrow more money and buy insurance
policies to cover what it was that you didn't have use of so that
you would have a guarantee that you might be able to have use
of something that you have no right to have a use for. Well,
I'm going to try to go as quickly as I can with this issue. The
principle that we have to live by is that we are not permitted
to have any indebtedness. And we can see the value of that, that
what is given to us is adequate. If it is not given to us, then
we have no business using it. If we ask for it and do not receive
it, we go and re-examine our asking and discover that it was improper
asking. It was inappropriate asking. And the same thing goes
for credit cards. How can we owe the petroleum company for gasoline
that we're using in our automobile when it isn't paid for, it
isn't ours? And we might not ever have the ability to pay for
it. Of course, then Satan has another little thing that comes
in real neat. You can just get it all relieved by claiming Chapter
11...you know, fresh start. And yet it really isn't a fresh
start - in a sense, it's held against you. But the principle
of our Father's Kingdom says that, "What I give to you, I
give to you, it is yours." He does not give us anything
that we owe Him for. We've talked about the only kind of indebtedness
that He knows anything about is when we go against Him. Then
we are creating an indebtedness against Him. That is hard to
pay for step by step, of course, unless relieved. But credit
cards therefore are taboo, unless you can have one because it
might help open a door for you and you <em>don't use it.</em> That
might be an okay thing. Now, that means even for automobiles,
yes, it means houses, it means everything, and we've got to cover
this issue more because that sign that 10 seconds are left just
went up and we'll start here next time and see how far we can
go.
