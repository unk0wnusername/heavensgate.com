A controversial object approaches the inner regions
of our solar system.  Those with the means of seeing Hale-Bopp
as it approaches argue over its size and its orbit.  They argue
whether or not it has a companion.  Those who have seen the companion
claim that it moves unlike any known natural phenomenon.
<p>
We, the students of the Level Above Human, think
there's a good possibility that Hale-Bopp is what we've been waiting
for.  We marvel at and are grateful for the patience of our Older
Member and the Next Level for putting up with us for so long.
 And we  wonder if there's any way to cram in these weak human
brains more of what we've been slow to learn to make ourselves
more presentable and acceptable for those who might be on their
way to pick us up.
<p>
Those charting Hale-Bopp's course, either in government-sanctioned
temples of science, or the backyard astronomers digging for evidence
of yet another government conspiracy in the lack of information
on Hale-Bopp being presented to the public, will most likely roll
their eyes at my linking this comet to our awaited exit from the
Earth.  They knew someone would try to connect this comet to religion.
<p>
And in our case they would be wrong.
<p>
Our message is not now, nor has it ever been, religious
or spiritual.  Hale-Bopp is not a phantom.  No matter what it
is, it will affect this planet.  Some say the strange weather
the planet is experiencing (coldest winters, wide spread floods,
etc.), the increase in volcanic eruptions and other furies of
nature, and the depletion of the ozone are already effects of
Hale-Bopp's proximity to Earth.  We've been saying the planet
was due to be recycled at the end of the age.  That is not religious
beliefs.  It is the planet's slate being wiped clean.  It is also
our offering exit to those who wake up enough to see that they
need to exit in order to survive.  Survival requires that you
allow nothing of this human existence to tie you here.  No wealth,
no position, no prestige, no family, no physical pleasure, and
no religion spouting to hang on to any of the above will enable
you to survive.  They are only entrapments.  They are means by
which the lower forces have lulled the humans of this planet into
being comfortable in their hell.  They promote the lies for their
own gain, or they themselves are not in touch with reality.  People
who find satisfaction in having everything of the material traps
that this planet has to offer stop looking for anything else.
 They stop having a need for God or Heaven.  They may go to church
every Sunday, but when the real Kingdom of Heaven and its Representatives
come calling, they don't recognize them or listen.  Their faith
and attention has been bought for trinkets and worldly things.
<p>
Consider a scenario where Hale-Bopp comes close enough
to devastate this planet.   Let's say this companion to Hale-Bopp
did indeed turn out to be a spaceship of the Next Level.  The
advanced occupants of this spaceship know the purpose of Hale-Bopp
is to recycle the planet.  They've sent it here to give the planet
a rest from the corrupt humans infesting it.  Suppose they send
shuttles ahead to rescue any soul worth saving.  We're not sure.
Perhaps Members of the Next Level would never communicate with
humans face-to-face.  The Old Testament of Judeo-Christian writing
says that humans died if they looked directly upon Members of
the Next Level.  But if it were possible, and Members of the Level
Above Humans personally invited individuals of this planet to
exit with them before the comet passed, what would your reaction
be?  Would you pass or fail the test of Lot's wife?  The old legends
say that when leaving Sodom and Gomorrah as it was being destroyed,
Lot's wife looked back and as a result was turned to a pillar
of salt.  Is there anything that would make you look back? 
<p>
Would your career have you hesitate?  Would your
wealth or position in the community cause you to pause?  When
faced with this decision, most humans could quickly adopt a different
set of values -- personal survival over materiel gain.  But what
do the majority of humans today say is the most important thing
in their lives?   Their family.  Would your thoughts of a spouse
or children hold you back?  Am I saying the all-important human
family is in the same category as trinkets and worldly things?
 Yes, IF it becomes a  stumbling block between you and your connection
or getting closer to the Level Above Human.
<p>
The human family is counterfeit -- as is anything else
that humans have come to value on this planet.  The proof of it
being counterfeit is in how easily a human family can fall apart
or be lost.  The only REAL "family" relationship that
can be maintained is that between an Older Member and a younger
member.  As long as the younger member keeps his eyes on his Older
Member, and wants with all his heart, mind and soul to please
his Older Member, that relationship is forever.  It was never
intended for human beings to reproduce in the same manner as animals.
 That path resulted from a poor, willful choice. Therefore, the
human family has become the Luciferians' most compelling entrapment.
<p>
There are humans who condemn other humans for participating
in what they see as promiscuous sex outside of a family unit.
 But they don't see that the sex engaged in to "raise a family"
or within the bounds of marriage is no different.  In fact, it
may be more of a trap because the human father, the human mother,
and those others tied to a human family, will have that much more
pulling at them to stay on the planet when it's time to get off.
  Exit is not a human family affair. Potentially each member could
go individually, but the family cannot go together as a unit.
<p>
The turmoil that this planet has always been in was
designed to stimulate souls to wake up and see the human kingdom
as temporary -- just a stepping stone to something more.  It was
never meant to be a peaceful place, and nothing will change that -- not
any human living on it or any renegade space alien, whether they
look like birds, fish, insects, or tall blond Barbie dolls, will
make peace or Heaven on Earth.  The increase in turmoil in the
last two decades directly correlates with the closing of this
Age.  The disruption will continue to increase as the comet approaches.
 Earth and its human level are the hell and purgatory of legend.
It wasn't meant as a place in which to get comfortable or to stay.
 It was set up as a place to separate the renegades of Heaven -- the
Luciferians -- from those who have risen above the human level, and
a place to test souls striving to get to the Level Above Human.
 Every corrupting distraction imaginable exists here.  A soul
going through here and not having its eye turned by the distractions
gains a lot of strength.
<p>
Even the human body can easily be lost.  Would losing
your human body keep your soul tied to this planet?  All human
bodies have spirits beyond their flesh, but not all have souls.
The soul is the only thing that offers movement beyond human shadows.
 It's the only thing of this hell that has no human origin.  Nothing
on this level, human or Luciferian, can destroy a soul.  That
power rests solely in the Next Level.
<p>
Souls are the gifts of the Next Level.  The Next
Level has some means of scanning a human plant, a human body,
to determine if it is fertile ground for a soul.  Once the soul
is planted, they also have a way of knowing if it has taken any
nourishment, that is, has accepted information from the Representative
they sent to nourish the souls that were planted -- that is, if it
has become an individual, something a little more than just human.
 How much contact with or acceptance of the Representative or
the information brought by the Representative warrants being saved
for future planting, I do not know.  Judgments of that kind are
reserved for those pushing the buttons of the spacecraft.  But
signs that a soul has accepted nourishment from the Level Above
Human would manifest as general discontent.  Individuals with
souls will feel out of place here because those souls are not
from here.  If these souls wake up, they see they can no longer
play the human game, if indeed they ever could.  They know that
what they see around them is not the way things are supposed to
be.  They have no difficulty seeing human existence for the hell
that it is.

<p>
If Members of the Level Above Human asked individuals
directly if they wish to exit before Hale-Bopp passes, they most
likely wouldn't ask any human that question.  Humans cannot go.
 It wouldn't even occur to humans to want to go.  Believe it or
not, the Next Level has no need for humans.  Human bodies can
serve as tools for helping developing souls of the Next Level
become stronger.  The soul can become strong enough to be awarded
a body from the Next Level if it keeps pushing in that direction.
 But the universe turns quite well without one human in it.  It
works because every Member of the Next Level focuses on pleasing,
and being more like his Older Member, and that Older Member would
in turn look to his Older Member, up the chain all the way to
the Chief of Chiefs.  This is the Tree of Life spoken of in legends
past.  There is no life without having some connection to the
Next Level.  There is not even potential for life without being
in the keeping of the Next Level.
<p>
Whether or not the Next Level arrives with Hale-Bopp,
it will arrive. Wall Street walkers speak in terms of investing
in things not easily lost.  Then a soul making an investment toward
the Next Level, toward its Older Member, would be making the only
worthwhile investment that exists.  Everything else here is subject
to crashing once the program of this hologram gets rebooted. 
To us, an invitation to exit Earth is an invitation to go home.
