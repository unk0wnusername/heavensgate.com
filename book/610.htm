<h4><strong>Some desire to advance beyond racial
consciousness</strong></h4><p> <h3><strong>Some beyond gender and sexual
consciousness</strong></h3><p> <h2><strong>Some beyond religious
consciousness</strong></h2> <h1><strong>Some Desire to Advance
Even</strong></h1> <h1><strong><center><font size="7">BEYOND all HUMAN
behavior</font></center></strong></h1> <h4><strong><center>for the sake of the
Evolutionary Level Above Human - "the Kingdom of
God"</center></strong></h4> <h5><em>SOME WHO ARE DEVOTING THEIR ENTIRE
LIVES TO THIS ENDEAVOR WILL SPEAK ON:</em></h5>
<ul>
<li>How this Evolutionary Level Above Human is a many-membered Kingdom - a
physical level of existence - above the human kingdom (with souls, minds,
and bodies - not just "spirit").  This Kingdom Level makes its
"Headquarters" in the most <em>distant</em> segment of the Heavens - outside of
"time" - from whence all Creation originates, both terrestrial and
extraterrestrial.

<li>How membership in the Kingdom Level Above Human is attained - by
outgrowing or rising above (overcoming) all human-mammalian
characteristics and behavior, including all forms of sexuality, human
family ties, addictions, and human self-serving ways.  This <em>overcoming</em> can
be done only under the direct personal tutorship of a member or members of
that Kingdom while they are incarnate in human bodies.

<li>How the door to that Kingdom is briefly open, for a second time, <em>now</em>
at the close of this Age.

<li><a name="lnk1"></a>How <em>life</em>, from the Kingdom of God's point of view,
begins when a soul receives <em>from</em> that Kingdom a "<em>deposit</em> of recognition"
of the information regarding that Kingdom Level's existence, and
recognition of a Representative from that Level Above Human.  <a name="lnk2"></a>The soul can choose to accept further <em>life</em>, or
"nourishment," from members of that Level indefinitely, or reject it at
any point and fall back into "darkness" (ignorance), or "death."

<li>How these Representatives from the Evolutionary Level Above Human
incarnated into (took over adult human bodies) in the mid-1970's and have been
separate from the world - practicing non-sexual, non-mammalian behavior -
for the past 18 years.

<li><a name="lnk3"></a>How religions have, in fact, <strong>unknowingly</strong> become
victims of slavery to "Luciferian" forces - "space races" - who represent
themselves to humans as "gods," but who are nothing more than technically
advanced humans (clinging to human behavior) from previous civilizations,
who use the discarnate (spirit) world to keep humans preoccupied with
their addictions, and who travel in primitive "UFOs."  The Next Level -
the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God - has truly advanced space-time travel vehicles,
or spacecrafts, and live in a non-temporal, non-perishable "world."

<li>How human physical bodies are only <em>containers</em> (suits of clothes) for
souls<strong>;</strong> how the <em>soul</em> is the <em>true identity</em><strong>;</strong> and how invasive influences -
discarnate "spirits" - can be recognized and aborted.

<li>How <em>this</em> information is the <strong><em>same</em></strong> information that the Next Level sent
with its Representative 2000 years ago.

<li>How the crucial question of the moment is<strong>:</strong> who of those who have
received a "deposit of recognition" will be able to choose to take this
"giant step"?<p>
