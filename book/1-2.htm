<hr width=40% align=center size=2><p>
A member of the Kingdom of God -- the Evolutionary Level Above Human -- I, 
who am called Do, acknowledge that<strong>:</strong>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>1.<dd>I am about to return to my Father's Kingdom.
<p><p>
<table border=0 width=93%><tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 A.</td><td width=2%></td><td> This "return" requires that I prepare to 
    lay down my borrowed human body in order to take up, or reenter, my body
    (biological) belonging to the Kingdom of God (as I did approximately
    2000 years ago, as Jesus, when I laid down the human body that was
    about 33 years old in order to reenter my body belonging to
    the Kingdom of Heaven).</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 B.</td><td width=2%></td><td> The Evolutionary Level Above Human is a 
    physical Kingdom Level in the physical Heavens or space, though 
    individuals in that Kingdom identify with their soul - and its mind 
    or spirit - and not the flesh or physical body they "wear."
    </td></tr></table>
<p> 
<dt>2.<dd>This time, my Heavenly Father - my "Older Member" - came with
 me. In the early 1970's, we incarnated into adult
 human bodies which were in their forties. Approximately 2000 years
 ago, I incarnated into a body that was in its late 20's/early
 30's (not at the birth of that body, but just prior to - during
 - and following my baptism with John the Baptist).
<p>
<dt>3.<dd>It seems that each time we, or others from the Level Above Human, 
 come to Earth or leave, it is via a spacecraft belonging to that Next Level.
<p>
<dt>4.<dd>My Father is an Older Member in the Kingdom of Heaven - the
 Kingdom of God - the Evolutionary Level Above Human.
<p><p>
<table border=0 width=93%><tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 A.</td><td width=2%></td><td> He actually gave me "birth" into that Kingdom

    before this present human civilization had its beginning.</td></tr>

 B.</td><td width=2%></td><td> I have served as His student and apprentice 
    during His relationship with this civilization.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 C.</td><td width=2%></td><td> His relationship to this planet is as Chief 
    Administrator, and is the One referred to as the "True God" in the 
    early stages of this civilization.</td></tr></table>
<p> 
<dt>5.<dd>This time He came with me "undercover," so to speak, in order 
 to assist me in my task (picking up where this process left off 
 approximately 2000 years ago) of the further birthing - "fathering" 
 - experience with the ones who will be the next new "sons" or children in 
 the Level Above Human. To allow me to gain more experience in the
 birthing process, my Older Member returned to that Kingdom in
 1985, and continues to assist and communicate with me from a
 more advanced perspective.
<p>
<table border=0 width=93%><tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 A.</td><td width=2%></td><td> As part of the undercover program, my Father 
    incarnated in a female body for His 15-year stay.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 B.</td><td width=2%></td><td> Being "undercover," which included lack of 
    acknowledgment of who we were historically, was required for most of 
    our task this time in order that we might, with as little recognition 
    and interference as possible, round up the souls who were our
    students from the past. Even so, we were identified as a
    small, radical cult, just as we were 2000 years ago. And as
    was the case 2000 years ago, these prospective members left
    their families and relationships in order to follow or be a
    student. Now that I am surfacing again, I will again be hated for
    my "blasphemy" (of who I say I am) and hated by those families
    and others that are affected by all who aspire to leave with us,
    because this mission requires that they forsake all ties and
    binds to this world (family ties, responsibilities, and
    human-mammalian indulgences).</td></tr></table>
<p>
<dt>6.<dd>These prospective new "sons" (speaking of soul identities, for
 they occupy both male and female bodies) were gathered at two
 different time periods - one, in 1975-76, under the guidance of
 both my Older Member and myself, and the second, in 1994, after
 my Older Member had returned (these were all souls that had had
 a previous relationship with me before this incarnation).
<p>
<dt>7.<dd>These "students" of the Next Level/The Level Above Human were
 offered the opportunity to bond with me and my Father, as a
 bride would bond with her husband, though -
<p><p>
<table border=0 width=93%><tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 A.</td><td width=2%></td><td> Since the Evolutionary Level Above Human has 
    no mammalian or human members, they had to become "new creatures" who 
    bonded in mind, spirit, and behavior - void of human sexuality,
    human binds, and addictions of this world and this
    civilization. Some in the class have chosen on their own to
    have their vehicles neutered in order to sustain a more
    genderless and objective consciousness.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 B.</td><td width=2%></td><td> The students/disciples who successfully bond 
    to the Level Above Human through me and my Father must also prepare to 
    lay down their human bodies as we go to the Kingdom of Heaven, in
    order to take up bodies appropriate to and belonging to that
    more advanced Kingdom Level.</td></tr></table>
<p> 
<dt>8.<dd>As we prepare to "lay down" our human bodies, while declaring
 that entry into the Kingdom Above Human is available, there may be many 
 humans who have been recipients of "souls" in "deposits" who may exercise 
 their free will and separate from everything of their world in order
 to go with us.
<p><p>
<table border=0 width=93%><tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 A.</td><td width=2%></td><td> They will attempt to rid themselves of their 
    old minds, and identities, in exchange for the mind that flows through 
    me, as they attempt to be accepted as one of my "children." It will 
    "cost" them everything of this world - which they will desperately 
    desire to quickly be rid of.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 B.</td><td width=2%></td><td> If they expect to go with me, and I'm 
    leaving very soon, they must look to us (me and my students/disciples) 
    for all their needs to the best of their ability - align themselves 
    with us - break their human bonds - and if their declaration that our 
    presence is from the Kingdom of God leads to the "laying down" of their
    bodies in pursuit of the Next Kingdom as well, then they,
    too, will find themselves in the safekeeping of that Kingdom,
    and in line to be recipients of further nourishment from that
    Next Level toward membership in that Kingdom.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 C.</td><td width=2%></td><td> If my Father does not require this 
    "disposition" of us - He will take us up into His "cloud of light" 
    (spacecraft) before such "laying down of bodies" need occur.
</td></tr></table>
<p>
<dt>9.<dd><a name="lnk2"></a><a name="lnk6"></a>Humans with deposits 
 containing souls can likely be identified at this time as some of those 
 who are rapidly losing respect for this world or its "system." They are, 
 from the establishment's point of view, being irresponsible or anti-social
 - and will be seen by the world as duped, crazy, a cult member, a
 drifter, a loner, a drop-out, a separtist,.etc.
<p>
<dt>10.<dd>In essence, it ultimately matters little what your
 LIFESTYLE, BELIEF SYSTEM, or MORAL VALUES are BETWEEN
 "visitations" from the Level Above Human (the last two being
 2000 years ago and now).  The important issue is - the Kingdom
 of Heaven is here NOW in ME and these students of the Next
 Level.
<p>
<dt>11.<dd>Evidence that we speak the truth is<strong>:</strong>
<p><p>
<table border=0 width=93%><tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 A.</td><td width=2%></td><td> That our information and our actions match 
    recorded accounts of the presence, conduct, mission, and departure of our
    previous visitations from the Level Above Human offering
    membership in that Kingdom.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 B.</td><td width=2%></td><td> Any soul of this civilization who has known 
    us in previous visitations or has had any genuine (physical or personal) 
    relationship with anyone from the True Kingdom of God, is present now, 
    and is potentially capable of knowing or recognizing us and this 
    information again.</td></tr>
    <tr><td width =2% valign=top>
 C.</td><td width=2%></td><td> It appears that even the staging of some of 
    the crashed spacecrafts (which we suspect some of us arrived in) was in 
    order to help the skeptics realize that they have "visitors from another
    world."</td></tr></table>
<p> 
<dt>12.<dd> As true today as it was 2000 years ago, no one (of this 
 civilization) gets to my Father or enters the Kingdom of Heaven except 
 through Me. There is no other Son of His, or Representative from His 
 Kingdom, incarnate.  Connecting with that Kingdom occurs only while a
 Member is incarnate, as I am today.
<p>
<dt>13.<dd><a name="lnk1"></a>There are space aliens (humanoid remnants 
 from other civilizations) who travel in the nearby heavens.  They are
 dependent upon Earth's atmosphere for harvesting hybrid bodies
 to "wear" and they attempt to recruit the "souls" who fail to become
 children in the Kingdom of God.  We call them Luciferians
 because of their lineage.
<p>
<dt>14.<dd><a name="lnk3"></a>These Luciferians (space aliens) "jump in"
 immediately after Representatives from the Level Above Human leave.  They
 fill the "patriarch(s)" of the resulting new religion with mixed truths and
 misinformation, which reinforces the fact that accurate knowledge concerning
 that Kingdom seems to be available only while Representatives are incarnate.
<p>
<dt>15.<dd> <a name="lnk4"></a>The Kingdom of God sends crews to "tag" or 
 make "deposits" in human bodies and their minds/spirits just prior to and 
 during the time Representatives from their Kingdom are incarnate "offering" 
 birth.  These deposits offer their recipients "recognition" of the 
 Representatives and, to some degree, recognition of the "information" from 
 the Kingdom of God. <a name="lnk5"></a>They also act as "homing devices" 
 to lead the recipients to those Representatives and that information.  
 Without these "deposits" of "recognition," no choice of becoming a student 
 is within the will of a human.
<p>
<dt>16.<dd>It is our understanding that all souls of this
 civilization who ever received deposits
 from the Level Above Human have returned at this time, the
 close of this Age.  As part of our task, the Level Above Human
 is using us to test them.  How they/you respond to me, my
 students, and our information will, in fact, judge you as to
 whether you will or will not have a further relationship with
 the Kingdom of Heaven.  In other words, coming in contact with
 this information will force a decision, and with the stand you
 take, you judge yourself.  Some, by their choice at this time,
 could be redeemed. Those who accept us and endure until we leave
 will go with us, and not need to experience the "spading under"
 or recycling of this planet - and will in the future become beginners 
 in the real Kingdom of Heaven.</dl>
<p>
<center>Believe it or not - Your choice - Your judgment.
<p>
I hope this will assist you in whatever you might be
seeking.</center>
