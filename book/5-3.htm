An "away team" from an Evolutionary Level Above Human, an "Admiral," His
"Captain," and crew, during the 1920's to 1950's picked and prepped the
human bodies which they would wear for the task we are about to describe.
They came into those bodies in the 1970's <strong>-</strong> the Admiral and Captain first
<storng>- then rounded up their crew in '75, and began assisting them in the
process of entering and taking charge of their own assigned human bodies.
They called their crew together by means of a public statement and
meetings (over about a 9-month period).  The unknowing public <strong>-</strong> through
the media <strong>-</strong> tagged them a UFO cult, for they couldn't understand what was
going on.<p>

The Two then took the ones who followed them into seclusion, completely
separate from the world for almost 17 years, not only to complete their
"awakening," or adjustment to their human bodies and this primitive
civilization, but also took them through a "metamorphic" classroom
experience of changing over their consciousness and behavior to match with
that of their distant culture from whence they had come.  Some humans also
followed them, out of curiosity or as a lark, while others seemed to be
searching for "cosmic consciousness," or to become a part of what some
might refer to as a religious "cult."  After the followers were, for the
most part, reduced to the crew that had come from space, they looked at
this task as their chance to finish what they had started 2000 years ago
on planet Earth <strong>-</strong> the changeover <strong>-</strong> overcoming of all human (all mammalian)
consciousness and behavior in order to move up into (inherit) physical
bodies evolutionarily appropriate for individuals in the Evolutionary
Level Above Human, bodies such as their Admiral and Captain had received
previously.<p>

This <a name="lnk1"></a>distant <strong>-</strong> highly evolved <strong>-</strong> civilization had
originally participated in the planting of this Earth's present
civilization, and had invested time, teaching, and association with some
of its inhabitants over the past 6000 years (Earth time), not to mention
the association it had had with this planet's previous civilizations.<p>

For an attempt at clarity, let's adopt a few terms or titles as tools of
reference <strong>-</strong> as we have previously used the Star Trek vernacular of
"Admiral" and "Captain" <strong>-</strong> for their true names, as used from whence they
came, are not to be given to humans.  Let's call the physical space or
area in the literal Heavens where their "Headquarters" is, the "NEXT
LEVEL," in place of the descriptive phrase <strong>-</strong> the Evolutionary Level Above
Human.  Also, let's call the <em><strong>space races</strong></em> (what
some humans refer to as space aliens), which are not associated with the
NEXT LEVEL or its Headquarters, "Luciferians," for they are all offshoot
civilizations from the period in history (prior to the present
civilization) when one-third of the "heavenly creatures" became renegades
from Headquarters <strong>-</strong> went out on their own and reverted to lower behavior
and interests which placed them in opposition to Headquarters.  By now you
realize that we are saying that the "NEXT LEVEL" and "Headquarters"
represent the only <em>true</em> Kingdom of God <strong>-</strong> a many-membered Kingdom
which physically exists in the Heavens and is the only place from which
souls, life, and all creating originates.<p>

Because of the Luciferians' extensive tampering with Earth's present
civilization, it has not been able to significantly serve as a stepping
stone toward the Next Evolutionary Level.<p>

The true Kingdom of God allows, and has for many civilizations, the
Luciferian presence and influence on Earth's surface in order to fulfill
the design of choice (free will) and options for developing souls.  Human
flesh bodies are suits of clothes (containers) for the soul.  They can act
as tools for evolutionary classroom progression.  At the human level they
are designed to have short life spans <strong>-</strong> as perennials.  Flesh bodies do
not (are not designed to) significantly evolve.  It is the soul which has
the potential to evolve from one biological kingdom level to another
biological kingdom level, if it can (with the help of Reps from the NEXT
LEVEL) make it out of the previous one.<p>

Obviously this present Earth's civilization is a young and primitive one, certainly from the eyes of those who have had the "good fortune" of being led into the true Kingdom of God.<p>

Two thousand years ago, Earth time, an Older Member in the true
Kingdom of God sent His "Son," a younger member in God's family, to offer
to "midwife" other souls (who had had previous nurturing from the NEXT
LEVEL) through the overcoming of humanness (breaking all ties with its
kingdom level in behavior, concepts, and attachments) and the grafting
onto that Next Evolutionary Level through Him (Jesus).  His disciples
started their weaning from the human kingdom and their new attachment to
the Kingdom of God, by choosing to learn only from Jesus and change
according to His direction as it was received from His Father <strong>-</strong> His Older
Member <strong>-</strong> who physically remained in the Heavens in one of the NEXT LEVEL's
spacecrafts.<p> 

Jesus' disciples were unable to complete their changeover during His short
tutorship and were promised by Him that He would come again at the end of
the Age (time present) to assist them in the completion of their Kingdom
Level transition.  Even though they had not completed their changeover,
we suspect that Jesus took them with Him to the NEXT LEVEL to await this
completion time opportunity.<p> 

This remaining phase (of metamorphosis
from human to a member in the Level Above Human) has nearly been completed,
as was earlier stated in the description of the Two who came, took human
vehicles, found their crew, and proceeded to use the primitive society
under Luciferian influence as their catalyst for overcoming.  Their
Admiral returned to the spacecraft leaving behind His human vehicle (a
female one) after the overcoming classroom had gotten well underway.<p>

Their "Captain" recently received instructions from his "Admiral" (his
Older Member) to disclose that he and most of their present away team is
the same away team that was present 2000 years ago.  They know that the
Luciferians through their human devotees, who presently find their main
stronghold among the seeming religious, will, in fact, be the catalyst for
the Age's end judging process.  All who condemn this truth and its bearers
will be condemned by the NEXT LEVEL <strong>-</strong> all who acknowledge this truth and
its deliverers, will be "saved" for future nurturing.<p> 

Now their last task is to once again offer what they have accomplished to
others who might get their change started.  However, as was the case 2000 years ago, and all
times previously that the NEXT LEVEL has had Representatives relate to
humans, those individuals who believe these "midwives" and start their
grafting to them as members and Representatives of the only true Kingdom
of God, will not have to worry about the planet's approaching recycling.
Not only can no Earthling or Luciferian hurt any member of the NEXT
LEVEL's "away team," for they have NEXT LEVEL bodies waiting for them in
one of their spacecrafts, nor can any harm come to any who believe and
become a part of them during these last days.  This statement represents
the away team's first announcement of their final task.<p>
