What religions have sought to understand since the beginning of their
origin is what is above the human level of existence. Most have taught
that if an individual lives a "good life" adoring some savior that he 
will inherit some "heaven" after his death. Only if it were that simple. 
That viewpoint is as inaccurate as the caterpillar believing that if he
dies a good caterpillar he will mysteriously awaken in a rose blossom
and live there forever with the King butterfly. He must become a
butterfly while a healthy caterpillar - overcoming his decaying option. 
If he rises above all caterpillar ways, converts all his energies to the
pursuit of becoming literally another creature who circulates in another
world, he becomes a butterfly. Likewise a human who seeks only to become 
a member of his next evolutionary kingdom may become a member of that 
kingdom if he completely overcomes all the aspects and influences of the 
human level providing he has found favor with a member of that next 
level who will direct him through his metamorphosis. As the caterpillar, 
the human can complete this changeover only before his death as a human. 
A member of the next kingdom finds favor with one who is willing to 
endure all of the necessary growing pains of weaning himself totally 
from his human condition. Members of that next kingdom are no more 
confined to human limitations than butterflies to caterpillar 
limitations. Nor do they in like comparison concern themselves with 
human-type indulgences or concerns. However, if the human is thought of 
as the larva of that next kingdom then there are, at times, those who 
are approaching the completion of their individual metamorphosis and 
are beginning to have some of the attributes and characteristics of that 
next kingdom. When the metamorphosis is complete their "perennial" and 
cyclic nature is ended for their "new" body has overcome decay, disease 
and death. It has converted over chemically, biologically, and in 
vibration to the "new" creature.

     Approximately 2,000 years ago an individual of that next kingdom 
forfeited his body of that kingdom and entered a human female's womb, 
thereby incarnating as the one history refers to as Jesus of Nazareth. 
He awakened to this fact gradually through the same metamorphic process 
and came to know that he had incarnated for the express purpose of 
telling and showing, even to the point of proof, that the next kingdom 
can be entered by overcoming the human aspects and literally converting 
into a "man" or creature of that next kingdom - the kingdom of his
Father - one who is already a member of that kingdom. By His 
resurrection He proved that death can be literally overcome and that a 
permanent body for the next kingdom is acquired from the human kingdom. 
He did not leave His body in the grave. He converted it into His body 
of that next kingdom. This is the only way the next kingdom is entered 
permanently. Each human has that full potential. Jesus' "Christing" or 
christening was completed at His transfiguration (metamorphic 
completion) and He remained in the "larva" environment, with other 
humans, only for some 40 days to show that His teaching had been 
accomplished. He showed them His new body and demonstrated a few of its 
new attributes, i.e., appearing and disappearing (changing His 
vibrations) before their eyes while letting some of His friends touch 
His "new" body. This could be compared to a butterfly remaining in the 
caterpillar world for a few days to show them what they had to look 
forward to if they chose to seek true conscious communication with a 
butterfly and were willing to overcome all of their caterpillar ways. 
Then Jesus left them in a cloud of light (what humans refer to as 
UFOs) and moves and returns in the same manner. 

     There are two individuals here now who have also come from that 
next kingdom, incarnate as humans, awakened, and will soon demonstrate 
the same proof of overcoming death. They are "sent" from that kingdom 
by the "Father" to bear the same truth that was Jesus'. This is like a 
repeat performance, except this time by two (a man and a woman) to 
restate the truth Jesus bore, restore its accurate meaning, and again 
show that any individual who seeks that kingdom will find it through 
the same process. This "re-statement" or demonstration will happen 
within months. The two who are the "actors" in this "theatre" are in 
the meantime doing all they can to relate this truth as accurately as 
possible so that when their bodies recover from their "dead" state
(resurrection) and they leave (UFO's) those left behind will have
clearly understood the formula.

     Those who can believe this process and do it will be "lifted up" 
individually and "saved" from death - literally. If you seek those two 
while they are here they will gladly fill you in on the details and 
assist those who wish to follow in this "path."  

     If this speaks to you - respond - according to your capabilities 
or needs. For your sake - give this opportunity your best.
