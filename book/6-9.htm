<li>Most who "say" they are looking for Him to return won't accept Him
(for He hasn't come in the way they expected).  <a name="lnk2"></a>Some of
those who've "had it" with today's religions will suspect that what He's
saying might be true.  A tiny few will know Him and that what He is saying
is true.

<li>There is a true Kingdom of God <strong>-</strong> a truly Evolutionary Kingdom Level
Above Human, above all mammalian or any other reproductive species.  It is
a many-membered Kingdom that exists in the literal Heavens, with its own
unique biological "containers" or bodies, and modes of travel <strong>-</strong>
spacecrafts or "UFOs."  It is, in fact, more physically real than the
world of the space aliens or humans.  This Next Kingdom Level created the
physical world, as we know it, as a "holographic classroom," and the
human-mammalian kingdom as a stepping stone.  That hologram is about to be
"re-booted" <strong>-</strong> canceled and restarted <strong>-</strong> for its usefulness and
serviceability as a classroom have come to an end.

<li><a name="lnk1"></a>All religions were designed as "prep" for this day,
but the "adversary forces" have corrupted them.

<li>Two thousand years ago, an Older Member in the real Kingdom of
Heaven, left behind His Next Level (non-mammalian) body and incarnated
into a "picked" and "prepped" human body at approx. its 29th year.  He
brought with Him the souls that His Father's Kingdom had nurtured in the
past, in order that He might help them incarnate and change over their
bodies.  That <em>formula</em> for being <em>born</em> into the Evolutionary Level Above
Human requires: the shedding of all human-mammalian behavior, such as all
forms of sexuality; ties to family, human relationships, and possessions;
addictions of all types; habits; and self-concerns. These must be replaced
with the thinking, the Mind, and the ways of the Next Level.

<li>That formula was brought again in 1975/76, by two Older Members from
that same Kingdom (who incarnated when the bodies that were "picked" and
"prepped" for them were in their early 40's).  They took the names "Bo
and Peep" and later, "Ti and Do."  They put out a "call" for the crew <strong>-</strong>
the souls who came with them - and helped them incarnate (take over their
bodies), while in isolation (separated from the world) for approx. 18
years.

<li>The Older Member of the two (Ti) left His human female body in
1985, returned to the physical Kingdom of God to re-enter His body in
that Next Level (from whence He still serves this project).  This finds
them once again, in the same relationship with the crew <strong>-</strong> and each other <strong>-</strong>
that they were in 2000 years ago.

<li>That "birthing" or incarnating procedure requires "midwifing" <strong>-</strong>
personal tutoring <strong>-</strong> by an Older Member from that Kingdom who is incarnate
in the human kingdom.  When a soul <strong>-</strong> one brought here by the Next Level <strong>-</strong>
incarnates, it must take control of a body (one that was "prepped" for it)
to the degree that it ceases to perform as a human sufficiently to
establish and sustain a well-founded loyalty to the Next Level through
that Older Member.  It is that loyalty and personal relationship with that
Older Member that motivates those behavioral changes, making that
"newborn" viable.

<li>A very accelerated "classroom" (for incarnating) is now being offered
for the third and last time in this civilization, by those representatives
from the 1975/76 "yield" to the remainder of the souls that have been
saved from a previous time by the Next Level.  In other words, that first
crew is gathering the remainder of their crew <strong>-</strong> holding meetings as of
January '94 <strong>-</strong> before exiting.

<li>If this information "strikes a chord" in you, you have received a
"chip" (of recognition) from the Next Level, though the hard work of
"changeover" can be done only by your unending effort under the
supervision of the Representatives who are here now.

<li>The two Representatives who came in the early 1970's, and their crew
(student reps), all came and will leave in spacecrafts or "clouds of
light" <strong>-</strong> the same way the Representative left 2000 years ago.</ul>
