<h1><center><strong>THE <em>ONLY</em> WAY OUT</h1>
<h1>OF THIS <em>CORRUPT</em> WORLD</center></strong></h1>
 
<center><em>(If you don't want <strong>out</strong> of the human kingdom,
you don't want <strong>into</strong> the Kingdom of Heaven.<br> You
<strong>can't</strong> have <strong>both.</strong>)</em></center>

<ul><h4><strong><center>THE SAME CREW THAT WAS HERE 2000 YEARS AGO WILL
SPEAK ON:</center></strong></h4></ul>
<ul>
<li>How the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God is a many-membered Kingdom
<strong>-</strong> a <em><strong>physical</strong></em> Kingdom Level
Above the human kingdom (with souls, minds, and bodies <strong>-</strong>
not just "spirit").  This Kingdom Level, what we refer to as the "Next
Level," makes its "Headquarters" in the <em>highest</em>, most
<em>distant</em> segment of the Heavens <strong>-</strong> outside of
"time."

<li>How membership in the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God is attained
<strong>-</strong> by overcoming all human-mammalian characteristics and
behavior under the direct personal tutorship of a member of that Kingdom.

<li>How <strong>-</strong> <em>now</em> at the close of this Age
<strong>-</strong> the door to that Kingdom is briefly open.

<li>How <em><strong>life</strong></em>, from the Kingdom of God's point of
view, begins when a soul receives <em>from</em> that Kingdom  "the gift of
recognition" of the <strong><em>Truth</em></strong> and recognition of a
<em>Truth <strong>bearer</strong></em> as one who is from the
<strong>true</strong> Kingdom Level Above Human.  The soul can choose to
accept further <em><strong>life</strong></em>, or "nourishment," from
members of that Kingdom indefinitely, or reject it at any point and fall
back into "darkness," or "death."

<li>How these representatives from the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God
incarnated (took adult human bodies) in the mid-1970's and have been
"lifted out" <strong>-</strong> separated from the world
<strong>-</strong> for the past 18 years.

<li>How many who <em>say</em> they honor God or Jesus have, in fact,
<strong>unknowingly</strong> become victims of slavery to Luciferian
forces <strong>-</strong> "space races" who represent themselves to
humans as "gods," but who are nothing more than technically advanced
humans (clinging to human behavior) from previous civilizations, who rule
over the discarnate (spirit) world and who travel in primitive "UFO's."
(The Next Level <strong>-</strong> the <em>true</em> Kingdom of God
<strong>-</strong> has the only truly advanced space-time travel
vehicles, or spacecrafts.)

<li>How human physical bodies are only <em>containers</em> (suits of
clothes) for souls<strong>;</strong> how the <em>soul</em> is the <em>true
identity</em><strong>;</strong> and how invasive influences and discarnate
spirits can be recognized, dealt with, and aborted.

<li>How the <strong>real</strong> question is, now that "test time" is
here, are the souls who have received the "gift of recognition" willing to
accept this Truth and these Representatives from that Kingdom?  </ul>
