Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 6
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr/>

Well, there you are again. This is the sixth session in our series,
and we're trying something a little different. We felt like we
got an instruction to just take a short break after our last session
and come right back and continue, because that last session seemed
to go in about 30 seconds. When one of our crew went over with
that card to hold up "10 seconds," I knew that their
clock was wrong, that certainly we hadn't gone through an hour
that quickly. But, I hope that we're right, that we do have instruction
to proceed. And so we're going to dive right in and pick up where
we left off.
<p>
In the few minutes that we did break, a couple of things occurred
to me as I thought back on what we discussed toward the end of
that session, and I want to dive back into a couple of aspects
of our last discussion. One is this<strong>:</strong> We talked about how the
door has to be open only a brief time. I didn't quite finish
the point that if you really play it out in your imagination,
that if there were an organization out there that was saying,
"Move out of your world, leave everything," and some
literally and physically <em>did</em> that, when you hear more about
the particulars of what overcoming is, you could see that if it
ever caught on, it would have a significant effect on the structure
of things. And it would certainly be a threat and be detrimental
to the system that Satan, or Lucifer, has engaged for society
at this point in an Age. Let's take, for example, in the churches
that began in the New Testament, particularly in the Pauline letters,
that as those churches continued to stay in the same town and
to teach the Truth (the facts), the Truth <em>had</em> to begin
to be watered down and watered down, in order for them to survive.
Otherwise, every last follower and every little church would
have disappeared. And in order to protect our endeavor of change,
in the same way, in '75, we had to disappear in order to be isolated.
In other words, we had to be separated out, or lifted out, in
order to be free to do what we had to do. And the same thing
would have to happen if you continue to take an interest in this.
And the further we go, if it speaks to you, then you would recognize
that, "Goodness, I'm going to be shortly, literally, physically
dropping out...dropping out of the world."
<p>
Another point that I mentioned briefly was the martyrdom that
occurred 2000 years ago. I said that it certainly isn't necessary
as an aspect of overcoming, even though the possibility exists.
But I feel that I must mention that religions that elevate such
things as martyrdom are certainly against our Father's Kingdom.
Our hope is that if this aspect of the harvest is successful,
we will be able to do it without too much interference. But if
interference is <em>needed</em> in order to bring us more quickly
to where we have to become, in order to be survivable in the Kingdom
of Heaven, then that's the whole issue that counts. Nothing can
happen to us, even though from a human point of view, certainly,
things can happen to us. They could hurt us. They could throw
us in jail. They could kill someone's vehicle, I mean if it got
that violent. Hopefully, the culture we live in here at the end
of the Age is a little bit more civilized than that, and we'll
put to test, I'm sure, the freedom of speech and the freedom of
religion and the freedom to worship God as you choose. It will
be put to the test again, no matter how short a time the door
is open. We're quite aware that that test will be out there again.
<p>
All right, on to the question that was asked as we closed out
that last hour, "Is overcoming a moral issue or is it a behavioral
difference"? We talked about how it's not particularly a
moral issue, even though some things might be more right than
other things because they are less harmful. And, in a sense,
anything that is behavior not becoming our Father's Household,
is immoral - it's wrong. But, in another sense, it's simply not
an acceptable way of life. The lifestyle in the Kingdom of Heaven
has no place for it<strong>;</strong> it does not exist. Therefore, if it does
not exist, then it needs to be fluffed off, or it needs to be
overcome. It needs to be risen above.
<p>
Let's say that in the Kingdom of Heaven, since babies do not
come in through woman's womb because they - the members in
our Father's Kingdom - are neither male nor female, and they
seem to all be about the same age, then to still have a mindset
at reproductive activity or sexuality, certainly, or even connecting
with the family in that way, that is inappropriate behavior. 
Therefore, in that sense, it's wrong if you are a potential student,
if you are in a position in your growth, if you have come to the
point of wanting to overcome the world (which I feel that if you're
still with us in a positive way, you more than likely have come),
and you're probably standing outside that vehicle right now having
a hard time with this because "Everything seemed to be going
pretty well until I heard this. Now I can't sleep at night. 
I'm being shattered." And you're probably more indulgent
in everything than you ever were before because you just don't
know what's going on. And if that's the case, I'm afraid the
earmarks might be there, that you might be marked, so to speak,
by our Father's Kingdom to be a possible recipient of this.
<p>
But just because our Father's Kingdom gives you that gift doesn't
ensure it. You still have to pursue it. You have to exert the
labor. You have to survive. You have to develop the muscle.
You have to be the one to make the choice to continue asking
and to move forward, step by step. And nearly every lesson in
the lesson plan comes with a difficult hurdle to make, a moment
of unpleasantness, at least a moment. Nearly every lesson, not
all, but many do. 
<p>
Okay, who's next?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, in discussing the particulars of overcoming, do
you want to start with separateness?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes, I'd like to go back to separateness. You know, in a
previous session, we talked about how "death" is synonymous
with "misinformation," "Truth" is "life."
If you really went to the root meaning of the Hebrew word "death,"
it would be "separation from God." The actual, realistic
definition of the term as it was intended when the language was
created by our Father's Kingdom, and as members of our Father's
Kingdom related to those human beings who used the Hebrew language,
"death" meant "separation." And separation
is, of course, synonymous with overcoming the world. I separate
from the world. What we're trying to overcome is separation from
our Father's Kingdom. We have been separate. Don't forget, what
is it that's coming to life here? It's the soul. Where did the
soul come from? Planet Earth? No. The soul was <em>created</em>
by our Heavenly Father, created by the Kingdom of God.
It was nurtured by Him<strong>;</strong> it came <em>only</em> from Him.
So, in that sense every soul that finds its place in His Household
is returning home, like E.T., wanting to go home. If that soul
begins to awaken, it knows "I'm going home, even though I
don't remember anything about home. It's been so long, and I've
been so tiny and so insignificant. And now I'm going to know
what home is like, even though I've been separated...how many thousands
of years have I been separated"!
<p>
More than likely, those of you who would choose to separate at
this time and let us assist you in your birth, in your going through
this canal to the other side, the pangs that you would experience
would be unequal to anything that you have ever experienced before.
And you can realistically know that - this sounds like we're
trying to set you up to feel good about yourself, but that's not
really the case - you came from the Kingdom of Heaven to do
this. You have been saved<strong>;</strong> you've been set aside in our Father's
Kingdom. You also got a briefing before you left on what you
might expect. You got some assistance in picking out a vehicle
that you could associate with to some degree, even from inception
or conception. And now you have to take over that vehicle, dominate
it. The soul has to come to life. The flesh has to become, in
a sense, dead, have no voice, just be a living mechanism that
will permit you to do what you want to do within the bounds of
a lesson ground. So, separation from our Father is the number
one, top-of-the-list type thing of overcoming. We're trying to
destroy separation. We're trying to get back to our Creator,
get back to our <em>only real Father</em>.
<p>
Now, our Father's Kingdom, in this particular Age, did associate
with the Jews and later with those who followed Jesus (like we've
talked about before). Remember way back, in the early parts of
the Age when our Father's Kingdom even hovered over the camp,
in a spacecraft, or a cloud, and related to them and gave instructions
to Moses and to the priests. And the Israelites saw a fire by
night, and they saw a cloud by day. It would move and it would
follow them where they would go, and they would have a place where
they could go and sit and concentrate on the lessons that they
were receiving. So, in a sense, our Father's Kingdom actually
had a Member from that Kingdom, in a vehicle from that Kingdom,
nurturing them, taking them through certain lessons.
<p>
But believe it or not, the human beings that our Heavenly Father's
Kingdom was associating with very quickly lost sight of the value
of that closeness, and the importance of that closeness, and wanted
their own way. "I want this to eat." "Well, I'm
tired of eating this. I want to eat that. I need to do this...."
And so pretty soon the Member says, "Well, I can't tell
you what to do. You have to make choices. You're no good to
our Father's Kingdom if I force you to do something. I can lay
before you what would be best for you, but then you have to make
the choice. And if you insist on compromising it, then I'll help
you even pick your compromise in the least harmful way to you."
And so, that whole business from Egypt and into the Promised
Land and all was just making one compromise after another for
the sake of the ones who continued to turn away from the will
of the Member of our Father's Kingdom that was seeing them through
that process.
<p>
Let's go on to our next aspect, ok?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> You touched on this, but what about independence, doing
what you want to do when you want to do it?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Well, I don't feel that I've really touched on it, because
boy, is that a booger! If there ever is an influence that's certainly
high up in the hard-to-overcome area, that's one that's difficult
for many individuals. Lucifer certainly knows how to get a grasp
in that one, because that's one of his strong points. That's
one he likes to keep you thinking you are happy in and are doing
what you want to do when you want to do it. Once you start in
the overcoming process, you don't have that freedom. You have
the freedom to walk out the door anytime you want to. But when
someone is assigned the task of taking you through a birth canal
from the human kingdom into our Father's Kingdom, it's not like
the one who took the tribes from Egypt into Israel, making compromises
because they kept insisting upon it. It's a different timetable.
And the Member from our Father's Kingdom who is a Representative
associating with you in that transition isn't willing to compromise
that much and does not get instruction to compromise that much.
They compromise a little and then they tighten the belt again.
Because the object is<strong>:</strong> we have a short time to get a long distance.
And in order to take advantage of the short time, then it does
require very accelerated forward motion. And that accelerated
forward motion does not leave the door open to compromise.
<p>
I can remember that in that Wyoming campground that I referred
to, after those 9 months of running around holding meetings, all
of a sudden Ti and I had to start saying, "We can't get anywhere.
We can't have our little meetings. We can't have our sessions,
if we're just so disorganized that this bunch is running off to
the laundromat at this hour and that bunch is running off to the
grocery store at that hour, and this one is doing that."
So, we had to have a structure, for the sake of getting somewhere
and having some instruction, and making a laboratory classroom
out of it, and changing our vernacular and changing our habits
and changing our ways. And that structure then immediately became
an infringement on "doing what I want to do when I want to
do it." And so the individual that was still dealing a lot
with, "I need that pizza, we haven't had pizza for two weeks,
or we haven't had pizza for three months, and we haven't been
to the picture show, or when we do go to the picture show, it's
not the one I really wanted to see, or I really feel like I need
so much of this to consume, or so much of that, and I don't like
okra, or whatever it is that I found on the menu yesterday."
<p>
To a large degree, the path of overcoming is one of <em>liberating</em>
you from structure, and in a sense at this point you could kind
of compare overcoming this world to a preparation program for
"God's Astronaut Program." If we're going to a place
where you can't just run off when you want to run off, have what
you want to have, and do what you want to do, then you have to
know that you have control. You don't need to have your pizza
when you want it. You don't need to "cat" around for
a couple of hours at night and run your car up and down Main Street.
You don't need to do this or that. You have grown up to the
point where your only concern is being a crew member, <em>being
a part of a crew</em>. And whatever the crew is assigned to, whatever
the crew wants to do, insignificant or significant, you are "crew
minded." Instructions are given to the crew, and you as
a crew member are crew minded. So, one of the major difficulties
that happens is this difficulty of getting rid of what I want
to do when I want to do it. Don't forget, it isn't really what
<em>you</em> want to do when you want to do it.
<p>
This brings up an interesting point. In a sense, even though
we're the little guy who has control of the option button, and
because we have free will as to what we listen to and what we
don't listen to, in a sense, we're "mediums." We're
all "mediums." I don't mean like mediums in the sense
of the Spiritualist church or the New Age mediums, but I'm not
condemning them. They're at levels of pursuit of trying to improve
their knowledge. But in a sense, we are "mediums."
What's funny is that when we are in the world, since there are
so many discarnates out there - so many individuals outside
of bodies - they use our body to do what they want to do.
A lot of times you've seen illustrations of that in a person.
Psychologists and psychiatrists have written books about it,
and there have been television shows about it - multiple personalities.
Even to the degree that if a vehicle permits it, and if the soul
that is supposed to be more strongly identifying with that vehicle
permits it, those individuals who are in the discarnate condition
will even come in and identify their name, and they'll be wow!
all these multiple personalities.
<p>
When Jesus said, 'When your eye is single, your whole body is
full of light.' And that means when there's only one soul in
there - there's only one pillowcase - it's only <em>you</em>.
So, it wasn't really <em>you</em> who liked to "run and do"
when you wanted to do it. It was you permitting others to use
you to run when they wanted you to run and indulge in what they
wanted to indulge in, because they could only get <em>feeling</em>
and <em>satisfaction</em> from participating in <strong>your</strong> vehicle,
and in a sense, <em>cohabiting</em> in your vehicle with you, in
order to get <em>their</em> desire taken care of. So, in that sense,
we're mediums. Our desire is to become vessels - another
word, same thing - for the mind of our Father's Kingdom, but
certainly not in the sense that humans interpret "mediumship."
Even though we would like to be able to kind of get in some unconscious
or trance state and say to our Older Member, "Just use us,
I'll disappear...You use us...." He says, "No, that's ridiculous.
We're not that stupid. Come on, now. If you <em>ask</em> Me,
I'll feed you information. If you're asking the right thing and
it's information that I have instruction to feed you, then I'll
give it to you." And in that sense, we are expected to grow
up a little bit, and understand how that mechanism of information
works.
<p>
What's our next question?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, in overcoming independence, what about needing
recognition or attention?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Okay, in a sense this "wanting to do what I want to
do when I want to do it" is a kind of independence. We said
<em>separateness</em> is kind of top-of-the-list, and we'll make
<em>independence</em> maybe somewhere close to the top of the list
of something that needs to be overcome. And you said independence,
is it also....
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Like needing recognition, or ego.
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Ego! That's good. Independence. Ego. I'll say that, believe
it or not, even <em>that</em>, for the most part, is not you, but
it's someone from the other side (a discarnate) who has not overcome
wanting humanness, or it could be you, because you're still listening
to that. A lot of times we listen to the influences that we're
still into. So, we can't really blame the influence, because
anytime we listen to an influence, then <em>we</em> obviously haven't
overcome it ourselves or we wouldn't be listening to the influence,
would we? So, independence, or ego, if I need attention, if I
need recognition, if I want to amount to <em>something</em>, then
these are the qualities that were taken from the human kingdom,
even into our Father's Kingdom long, long, long, long time ago
by someone called Lucifer. He still couldn't get his eye off
of himself, wanting to be somebody, being impatient with his assigned
tasks, his being a member of a crew, his having to wait for instruction
to come down, and he wanted to be somebody. He wanted to develop.
And then that meant that he didn't trust in the One who was taking
him through development. A lot of overcoming is a matter of patience
- a matter of waiting. I mean, we spend a lot of time waiting,
learning to overcome being disturbed by waiting or threatened
by waiting. But independence is certainly synonymous with separateness.
It's certainly synonymous with ego, selfishness, wanting attention,
wanting to have identity, wanting to have its own flock, wanting
to have its own corporation. So, yes, if that's something you've
had to deal with, that you have not overcome, and most have to
deal with it to a degree when they are in the human kingdom, then
this is another on our list of helping you understand some of
what you are up against if you still need that recognition, or
if you still need that independence, that separateness.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, what about rebelliousness?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I'm afraid that I would pretty much treat rebelliousness as
just a side "symptom" of independence. Rebelliousness
is just a next step of independence. It says, "I wanted
to do it and you didn't let me do it, so I'm going to rebel."
And, unfortunately, then, you find yourself on the threshold
of the Next Level saying to you, "I can't force you to do
it. This isn't the name of the game, of forcing someone to do
it. I can't make you, make you, make you do it. You have to
make me, make me, make me rehelp you, rehelp you, rehelp you."
The initiation has to come on the part of the seeker. Repeatedly,
repeatedly. If the thirst is weak, boy! are we in trouble. If
the desire to change is weak, are we in trouble, because the teachers
don't get anywhere. When they see us going slow and they try
to impose it on us, it just doesn't move. The movement forward
occurs in direct proportion to the thirst of the individual, the
desire for change, the desire of speed in that change, the muscle
exerted to control that change, to rise out of that desire and
discard it, and look for something better and be ready for it.
And say, "Here I am. I'm ready for the next step, and the
next instruction."
<p>
Of course, you'd be surprised. Those old tests keep coming back.
The Next Level sends them back to us to be sure that we've really
licked them and to give us another little chance to prove that
we have. We can re-examine them. Sometimes they come back even
stronger. We thought, "Wow! I thought I'd gotten past that
one and didn't have to deal with that anymore." Then, some
night, in the middle of the night, or in total surprise, you have
something return that you thought you had really overcome and
it comes as such a shock. But pretty soon you get wise, and you
know that it's going to return, and you're prepared for it. But
you don't think about it.
If you fear it and you think about it, you're inviting it. So, you have
to block it. It doesn't exist. Don't even acknowledge it. It isn't there.
And then when it comes, and you're surprised, you deal with it.
You get rid of it. And then you learn to be quicker in dealing
with it - quicker and quicker and quicker. At first you might
make the mistake of hearing its argument. Then soon you hear
less of its argument and less of its argument. And as you progress,
you even begin to "smell" it before you can even identify
its argument, and you put up a block for it. You put a big old
Yale lock on that door before it gets to the door, because you
could smell that particular quality or characteristic returning
that you had once listened to.
<p>
What's next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> It occurred to me when you were talking about independence
- will our viewers be left feeling a void if they get rid of their
independent thinking?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> No, I'm glad you brought that up. Yes, that's good. You
know, when you run around in the human world, all of these discarnates
that are using you to be their medium, and they're having their
own pleasures through you, are also really making a place for
you in the world. I mean, they give you identity. They give
you success and careers. For example, it does not mean that if
a spirit is in a vehicle and that spirit very quickly is a child
prodigy at the piano that that spirit was necessarily a good pianist
in the lifetime. That spirit may have had just a little bit of
piano experience in a previous lifetime. And then the spirit
of a real proficient pianist says, "I've found a vehicle
(body) that has enough proficiency that I think I can hop into,
and boy can we go." And then does that vehicle, and that
spirit, get excited, because here comes a pianist (discarnate)
in and this person has developed into just an astounding success
as a pianist. Actually, any of those spirits <em>can</em> take
possession if they want to. A lot of them don't really want to
take possession. They just want to use a vehicle. Because once
you take possession, then you're <em>responsible</em> for it, and
you've also endured running everybody else off - all these other
cohabitating influences that were trying to utilize that soul.
But that independence thing, like I said, really wasn't independence.
It was these other influences - these other discarnates
- using you to accomplish what they want to accomplish. So, to
answer the question, as you run those guys off, you begin to lose
your talents, you begin to lose your identity. Everyone arrives
at a condition where they say, "I just don't know who I am
anymore. I've just lost everything." And even though that
can seem so traumatic to them, it's the best place they can find
themselves. Because at that point, they can turn right around
and say, "I must be succeeding in this task of overcoming."
<p>
What do I want to be? I want to be putty. I want to be putty
in the hands of my Heavenly Father's Kingdom. That's what I said
I craved. Now, here I'm put to the test. Do I crave that? Do
I care about I, I, I...or do I want only to be a servant? Do I even
want to be <em>a servant</em>, or do I just want to be any servant?
Do I want to be available? Am I satisfied with being available
and not interrupting, not causing problems, but being someone
who can contribute? Maybe if all I can contribute is to mix the
batter for the cake, then can I do it without causing problems
with the other crew members? Can I do it in a right relationship
with them? Or do I want to shine somehow?
<p>
All this effort that's been made by metaphysicians and certain
New Age groups to have life readings and to try to help people
identify with their past, I'm afraid, does more harm than it does
good. It doesn't do any harm to know that you've more than likely
had a past and it might have been a lengthy one, but if I connect
you with that past and try to bring it into realism, I can also
turn on old buttons that you worked hard to turn off. I can remind
you of your alcoholism, or I can bring it back into place, or
I can remind you of whatever it was that you worked so hard to
overcome. And knowing that past is of no significance. There's
only one past that is of significance to you, and that is <em>your
past relationship with your Heavenly Father, and His relationship
with this kingdom, His relationship with His Representatives,
your relationship with His Representatives, His Kingdom, and anyone
else that was associated with His Kingdom that you have come into
contact with - that's the only past that is of any significance
to you.</em>
<p>
I believe that Ti and I can safely say that we cannot remember,
nor do I expect that we will remember when we're back in the activity
of our Father's Kingdom, that we will see a posting of a piano
concert anywhere, or that we'll see a posting of an NFL football
game, or of the Presbyterians, or of any other profession that
I could think of that exists in this kingdom level and does not
exist in that one. Now, I'm not condemning those things. They
were lesson grounds - they were stepping stones - they were places
to get into, learn from, and get out of, and to rise above, to
see through, to get new values and see that they weren't as valuable
as you thought they were. A real irony here is that from our
Father's point of view, the most intelligent - or what humans
would call the most intelligent - people, and the most schooled
people, and the most really scholarly people are most usually
from our Father's point of view the most ignorant. Frequently,
the person who has no schooling at all, who might at this moment
be a street person or a wino or live in the sticks in the Appalachian
Mountains, but they sit out on that little mountain and talk to their
God all the time and wonder why it is that they feel guilty about
some of the conduct that goes on in their life and in their household,
and sometimes the most simple people that deal with the most simple
problems get closer. And they usually <em>are</em> simple people
dealing with simple problems also<em> because</em> of their relationship
with their Father. Don't forget that the growth pattern is<strong>:</strong> 
When I <em>ask</em>, He usually presents me with something that
I could see as a problem or I can see as a positive and move forward
from that.
<p>
What's next on our overcoming list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> If you think we've covered independence, for the moment,
shall we move on to overcoming sensuality?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> I'm sure we'll come back to independence, but sensuality is
such a big, big picture, and it is so separate from our Father's
Kingdom. It is so inappropriate for our Father's Kingdom, because,
as we have discussed, the reproductive system is not existent
in our Father's Kingdom. Of course, sensuality has many aspects,
if you consider all of the senses - the emotions, the moods,
the needing of affection, the needing of attention - all those
are aspects of sensuality. And so is the indulgence in stimulants,
in needing your coffee, or needing your alcohol, or needing your
booze, or whatever it is that you like to hide in. But, let's
narrow sensuality down for a few minutes to sexuality, because
it's certainly as major an issue for humans, if not <em>the</em>
area, that Satan works the hardest to keep you addicted to.
I don't know of a human that isn't addicted
to sensuality and sexuality. Of course, if they weren't, they
wouldn't be a human, so I'm pretty safe in saying that.
<p>
Now, I must in all fairness question what I just said, because
there might be some, certainly some monks and nuns and hermits
and ones in all kinds of different religions, who keep that intact.
I have to talk about something here for a moment that I feel
is abominable to the Kingdom of Heaven. You know, I've read of
groups that are pretty esoteric, pretty hidden, like certain Essene
groups and certain monastic orders and certain isolated religions,
that would even go so far as to stimulate their sexuality, as
if by stimulating their sexuality it somehow or another sent that
energy force, that kundalini, into the brain and caused more capacity
for enlightenment or development. That's a counterfeit of the
truth. It is true that as you restrict yourself and separate
from sensuality and sexuality, and as you close that door totally,
and those hormones stop acting in your vehicle, and even when
they act, you don't hear them and you don't give in to them in
the least, it is true that then you move into a greater capacity
for higher knowledge and higher understanding and more muscle
and more strength to deal with things other than sensuality and
sexuality. But the counterfeit of that is to, in some sort of
ridiculous way, stimulate sensuality or sexuality for some kind
of spiritual trip that is hideous to our Father's Kingdom. That's
a perversion of the way control was designed to come. I hate
to, but I must address that directly. That is not the truth.
Even though, certainly, Ti and I investigated it - Ti and I investigated
it seriously. We studied it as we studied everything else during
the period of our awakening, and it was made so clear to us that
it was not of our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
Now, sensuality...I think the next place to begin on this is probably
to discuss love, because Satan has humans confuse love with sexuality.
And love in our Father's House has no relationship with sexuality.
One illustration that was given to us to think about was<strong>:</strong> if
you're from my Father's House, you cannot imagine yourself in
a position of being in the act of sexuality in full, broad daylight,
and while in the act look up at your Heavenly Father and say,
"I know that I am only expressing your love." When
you become a candidate for our Father's Kingdom, in a sense, our
Father then begins to get your eyes focused on His Kingdom and
says, "I'm a jealous God. For a period of time, you might
have thought you loved Me more than you loved those other things,
but if you're going to get into My House, you have to love <em>only</em>
Me, you can't love anything else out there. You love only Me.
I don't have sex," He says. "I'm not a sexual creature.
I don't even have the plumbing for it. We don't <em>do</em> that
kind of thing. Therefore, it's obviously not an expression of
love, as far as I'm concerned."
<p>
For a while in our classroom, after Ti first left her vehicle
and I was still trying to get out of the shock of it and help
the students through the shock of it, if I was gone from them
for a period of time and I returned, I would hug them and try
to show my affection for them. And after a while, I began to
feel, "This is inappropriate. We need to get past this.
This is less than right. It may not have done any harm for a
period of time, but it's inappropriate. The band-aid might have
worked, but we don't need the band-aid any longer." That
doesn't mean that we don't love each other. We do love each other
if our Father desires for us to love each other, and to the degree
that is right from His eyes for us to love each other. But we
don't love each other certainly in any physical nature where we
need to touch or we need to hold hands or we need to hug or we
need to kiss. We don't need those things. And it's certainly
safer to avoid them during this more advanced position of overcoming,
because in some we might innocently retrigger something. If they
were permitted to engage in touching or hugging or even kissing
on the cheek, it would re-engage something that they have worked
very hard to overcome. So, we certainly don't want to re-engage
an old addiction. And withdrawing from the drug of sensuality
and sexuality is as difficult a withdrawal, if not more difficult,
than any other withdrawal. It's tough. And Satan keeps sending
it back again and again and again, to test you. Because those
hormones keep being stimulated, even by things you might consume,
by a commercial that you might see on television. I mean this
day and time, from toothpaste to trousers, everything is done
based upon the sexual appeal of something. There's hardly a commercial
on TV that isn't based on sexual appeal.
<p>
So, sensuality has so many aspects to it. But remember, since
it is not a behavior that even exists in our Father's Kingdom,
then to someone who's trying to get from here to there, it's something
we have to go through the withdrawal of, we have to overcome,
we have to rise above, we have to have <em>in control</em>, and
we get help having it in control. We don't need to fall off the
wagon. We learn to not even listen to it. We learn to quickly
turn our head if a magazine catches our eye in a supermarket that
has pictures on it that would have triggered the vehicle in a
previous time, then we quickly don't see it. If a television
show or a movie has a moment of sensuality, you know, it's almost
as if a movie can hardly hit the marketplace if it doesn't have
a certain amount of scenes in it of sensuality or sexuality. 
And if you've really advanced in the process of overcoming, you're
very sensitive to those vibrations, and you're very uncomfortable
with those vibrations. You have to quickly just turn away. You
don't need to stand up and wave a flag or shout at the audience
and say, "Oh, turn that film off." But you certainly
need to have control of your eyes, not let the vehicle see it,
not let it even play internally in your head.
<p>
When Jesus said, 'When someone looks upon someone lustfully,
they've committed the act,' that meant that there's no difference.
So, if we do that act even in our head, we certainly haven't
overcome the act. This is one step<strong>;</strong> we're not doing the act
physically. But, that's just one step. Another step is not even
permitting those thoughts, those images, to come into our head.
So, it's a big item. It's a major item. It has many, many facets
and many lessons. Now, I've mentioned things like movies and
magazines, and the fact that we don't just go where we want to
when we want to go. You could think that we live a pretty sterile
existence, but it's only as sterile as we like it. I don't mean
for you to misunderstand that. We view a lot of television, we
go to movies, we have a lot of variety in the things that we consume.
We have a lot of times when we sit and have lessons and meetings,
even when we're broken into separate groups in different places.
We have all kinds of things given to us that serve as the vehicle
for our lessons.
<p>
It's true that if we have to deal with a lot of restlessness,
then we have to get control of that. We have books to read, not
only Bibles, but all kinds of books to read. Just about everything
that you can think of, but certainly not books that would trigger
or turn on old weaknesses that we're working so hard to overcome.
Even though some of the books we've had might have some pages
in it that we may skip over. That is the same as when different
ones in the class will climb in a vehicle (car) and go to the
movie. They know that they can see that movie and they can turn
off a scene.
But they also do censor the movie to the degree
that if the movie has too much of that in it, they consider it
off their list. They don't want to see it. It's not worth it
to them.
<p>
Oh, while I'm thinking about a movie, I have to bring up that
the class recently saw the movie "Hook," and it was
interesting. Of course, Hook represents evil, or Satan, and Peter
Pan represents the good guy. When Hook had Peter's rightful son
in his presence, he wanted really to see if he couldn't get Peter's
children to see him as father and to imitate him. He didn't have
much success with Peter's daughter. She couldn't quite stop doing
anything but missing Peter. But because the son didn't really
understand much about Peter as his father, the son for awhile
"bought into" Hook, because Hook gave him so much attention
and elevated him so, as does Satan. He gives you a lot of attention.
He elevates you so, and he even lets you imitate him. He can
give you all kinds of success and authority and power and things
of <em>this</em> world. But as soon as Peter came back in the picture,
and Peter's son really began to see Peter for what he was, the
son apologized to his father, and he said, "I'm yours. Hook
is not my father." And he quickly realized how much he had
gone astray. And, of course, Peter felt guilty, because Peter
felt like he hadn't really let his son know him. That what his
son knew of him wasn't enough to win him. So, Peter certainly
understood how his son could go for Hook. Well, I'm sorry. I
had to bring that illustration up. It was a good one. And the
movie had a lot of good parallel lessons in it as far as the conflict
between good and evil are concerned.
<p>
What's next on our little list? Were there some particulars
about sensuality that we were going to bring up?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, yes, would you want to say something about costume,
and jewelry?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> (Laughs) Okay. This gets into an area where some of you
could say, "Oh, those who are with this Representative, or
with this group, or with this cult, seem to have an identity."
We have a kind of identity that is trying to <em>not</em> have
another kind of identity. Since we're moving into a world that
is genderless, then we try to not be associated with the gender
of our vehicles. Females are not trying to look like males. 
Males are not trying to look like females. They're trying to
be neither. They're trying to be both - in the <em>purest</em>
sense, but not in the human sense. So, what do we do? An aspect
of human female consciousness would be to use a certain amount
of makeup, tend to the hair, go to the beauty parlor, spend time
on the rollers, earrings, jewelry, tight waist, short skirt. 
In the same way the male consciousness would be to wear tight
blue jeans, tight belt, tight shirt, cowboy boots, and be Mr.
Macho or whatever it is. We are trying to have no masculine characteristics,
no feminine characteristics, but in a sense, still sensitive and
soft, but neither male nor female - genderless.
<p>
So, it is true that members of the class cut their hair in the
way that's easiest to care for. The class members cut each other's
hair so they don't have to go to the human beauty parlor<strong>;</strong> they
can have their own barbershop wherever they are. Some are assigned
the task of barbering because they do less "butchering"
in the process than the others. Even though whenever I'm with
them I question, "Who did that haircut? Who did so-and-so's
hair"? (Laughs) "The neck's not tapered very well."
But they do have a haircut that is pretty much neither male nor
female and one that they can handle and is easy to care for. 
They can wash their hair every day, it's clean, it's off their
neck, they don't have to give it any attention, and it doesn't
attract any attention out there in the world.
<p>
As far as the clothing they wear, they wear pretty much unisex-type
clothes, that certainly <em>aren't</em> tight fitting, and they
wear a <em>loose</em> shirt. Sometimes the shirt is bought in the
store in a department that sells items for both male and female.
And sometimes whether you go into Marshall's or Ross' or some
of the discount stores, you might find the same shirt in the women's
department that you'd find in the men's department. The only
thing that's changed is their sizes. But they want loose-fitting
things that do not accentuate the waist or the hips or any shape
of the vehicle. They don't need to color themselves. They don't
need lipstick or rouge. They try to stay clean and neat and well
taken care of and try not to vibrate attracting anyone, but they
also don't want to vibrate repelling anyone. They just want to
be neutral. They want to be just objective. They try to control
that vibration. And so, certainly it affects the items of jewelry,
makeup, haircuts, clothing. And as hard as they try to kind of
be <em>unidentified</em> in that way, whenever they go someplace
and then they go back to that place again - for example, if a
partnership goes to a market, then <em>another</em> partnership
goes to that same market - inevitably, if they go to the same
checkout counter, the person says, "Well, I saw you here
just yesterday!" Even though they weren't the same ones
at all, it was someone else in the classroom. Their vibration
seems to be so different from the humans that they are mistaken
for each other frequently. We try so <em>hard</em> not to have
the clothes look alike, and in spite of our effort, the class
members all seem to look alike in the eyes of others, and so we
try to work hard at not doing that, or at least knowing that that
possibility exists.
<p>
But, you have to examine - you have to say - "Do I need
to <em>cling</em> to my femininity? Do I need to <em>cling</em> to
my masculinity"? Because if you do, then you're not really
<em>ready</em> to make this transition from the human kingdom into
our Father's Kingdom. If you go back and read your scriptures,
you'll find that there is no marrying, there is no male nor female,
so it is a <em>genderless</em> Kingdom.
<p>
I'm glad we had a chance to get <em>started</em> a little bit in
some of these other aspects of overcoming. We've given you a
lot to think about. You know, as I look about, as I think about
our previous session, as I go over it in my head, I know that
we weeded out quite a few who watched that session, and of those
who watch this session, we'll probably weed out quite a few more.
And we keep wondering where is it going to end? Will we weed
them out so that no one responds? And if that's what happens,
if we're doing the will of our Father, then that's all that matters
to us. We're not getting any points by how many might listen
to us and follow us. We only want to do what is <em>instruction</em>
from our Father's Kingdom.
I see those cards. That last one said 10 seconds,
and that one now says 5. We'll see you in our next session and
we're <em>glad</em> that we're here.
