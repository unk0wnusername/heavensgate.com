Beyond Human -- <em>The Last Call</em> - Session 7
</strong>
(60 Min)
</center></h2>
<hr>

Welcome to our seventh session. These are going on and on, aren't
they? If you noticed on the double exposure at the beginning
of today's program, two students are working with me again today,
serving as teleprompters or helping me fill in the parts of the
big picture that I might leave out. Let's just get going and
start with the first question.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Who was speaking when Jesus said, "I will come again"?

<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Boy, that's a big question. A picture comes in when that
question is addressed that is monumental. We must address that
question. Who was speaking when Jesus said...or another way to say
it, <em>who</em> was saying, "I will come again"? There
are a number of reasons that that issue is so important to us
as we anticipate His return, or our Father's return - because
we want to be ready and we don't want to make the mistake of wrong
identity. I believe that in an earlier tape we discussed that
you might be disappointed if you are anticipating some spacecraft
coming over the Mount of Olives or someplace in the Middle East
or in the Israel area, and it hovers there, or it rests over that
mountain, and an individual steps out and comes down through the
air with a flowing white robe and flowing long hair, looking like
the picture that artists have depicted of Jesus and shows his
scars and says, "Here am I, Jesus." Now I believe we've
said something that some of you certainly could respond to negatively,
or feel that it is blasphemous for us to say. I'm afraid that
would be a trick that Lucifer, or Satan, would pull to have you
satisfied with something that you're anticipating. Well, what
did Jesus say? Not only did Jesus say, "I will come again,"
He also said, "if someone says that 'I'm over here,' or if
'He (Jesus) is over there,' or 'He's hidden there,' or 'He is
on this mountain,' don't believe him." Well, what will we
do? One says, "I'm coming again," and another one says,
"If somebody says that He's there, don't believe him."
So, how do we understand that? How do we put that together?
Well, I'm going to skip to something that we're dealing with
right now in our classroom and in our preparation of these sessions
for you.
<p>
Yesterday we taped Session 7 and Session 8, and you heard me
a moment ago say, "Welcome to our seventh session."
We're re-recording 7 and 8 because I felt that in addressing
Ti and asking Ti in the night, "There was something wrong
with one of those sessions. What was it? What was wrong"?
Around 3 am or before, the picture began to clarify in my head.
I certainly feel that it was my Older Member clarifying it, helping
me see that "I" had come in to the picture in an issue
that we brought up in the seventh session. Therefore, it was
necessary to do the seventh session over again, or it was certainly
our choice to do it, and we chose to do it because we don't like
to be off track.
<p>
We've talked about, before, that when <em>I</em> comes in, then
<em>I</em> can lead astray. When <em>I</em> comes in, if it's <em>I,</em>
Do, or if it's <em>I,</em> this vehicle, or if it's the word <em>I</em>
being used and it is something different from what my Father,
my Older Member, would say through me, then I'm off track. Now
what was it that we did that we considered that was worthy of
our retaping those sessions? I want to explain that to you now,
because it <em>hurt</em> me. It meant a lot to me that I could
so easily go astray and not realize it. What happened was that
on that seventh session, I shared with the audience some of the
overcoming experiences that this vehicle had experienced, some
of the addictions that it had had in the world, and some of the
difficulty it had had in overcoming those addictions, thinking
- and I guess that was my trouble - that by helping you see
some of the things this vehicle had dealt with that it might assist
you as a possible overcomer to not think so poorly of yourself
if you might have had those same addictions to deal with or similar
ones to deal with. And yet it was made clear to me in the night,
that for me to slip into a position where I am addressing something
that this vehicle or even this soul might have dealt with, is
to separate from my Older Member. When I separate from my Older
Member, at the same time I separate from my Older Member's Older
Member. I separate from our Heavenly Father. I separate from
the Kingdom of Heaven.
<p>
Anytime <em>I</em> comes in and it's an identity, and my mouth
is being used, and I'm discussing something that is unique to
this vehicle, or unique to Do, or unique to whatever name tag
was placed on this soul prior to its existence, even when identified
as Do, then for the time that I am discussing that identity, my
Older Member, my Heavenly Father through my Older Member, is not
speaking through me because that was not the truth for <em>them</em>.
If I speak of something in my past that was not my Older Member's
past, then I am separate for the time that I am discussing it.
I'll try not to repeat myself too much here, but maybe I need
to continue to repeat in order to try to help you understand the
complexity of this issue and the importance of this issue.
<p>
We discussed a little bit how in a sense we're all mediums. 
There are two minds that can flow through us - the mind of
our Father's Kingdom, and the mind of Satan's Kingdom - and
we try to sort it out. We try to move more so that only the mind
of our Father's Kingdom is speaking, or certainly get into the
percentages where the majority of that mind that is speaking is
from our Father's Kingdom. And then slowly we identify more and
more what is <em>not</em> of our Father's Kingdom, and we abort
it, and we abort it, and we separate from it.
<p>
A very key issue in separating from what is not of our Father's
Kingdom and destroying identity was pointed out to me in the night,
in this particular lesson that we are experiencing, of how
I went awry. For me to remember and relate to - even if I
did it in my own head and did not voice it - something that this
vehicle experienced or that Do experienced, or the individual
that this soul might have been labeled prior to Do, is to separate
from my Father. My Father cannot say through me, "at one
time my vehicle experienced this...." I don't <em>know</em> what
my Father's vehicle experienced. So, <em>who's</em> talking? It's
obviously not my Father. It's not my Older Member. It's not
my Older Member's Older Member. It's somebody else, and therefore,
for the time that I am identifying with that, then it is not my
Heavenly Father, my Older Member speaking. I am not a vessel
- I am a separate identity.
<p>
When Jesus tried to tell them that the Father speaks through
Him, and that He and His Father are one, He was trying to help
them understand this same process that we're discussing right
now. And I'm so <em>glad</em> that it was pointed out to me and
I was reminded how easily I can get off the track in that way.
Now, if I am going to abide by the rules of overcoming, one rule
that is addressed in overcoming is<strong>:</strong> when someone begins an overcoming
task as a student of overcoming, we leave the past behind. Whatever
we have been is left behind.
<p>
We see clearly that we have to go a step further than leaving
it behind. We have to actually <em>forget</em> it. We have to
be <em>unable</em> to remember it. If in truth when Jesus told
his disciples that when you have acknowledged something and you
have asked forgiveness for your separateness, that the slate is
clean, it is wiped, it is no longer there. If it is no longer
there, then I can't remember it. If the slate is really clean,
it is not there. If I remember it and dredge it up, I bring it
back, I relate to it, and for the time I'm relating to it, I am
separate. I am certainly not a vessel, and I am identifying with
my past. In a sense, I'm almost triggering old responses, turning
on old addictions. Now that may be an exaggeration, but the possibility
exists. That's the reason it's so <em>deadly</em> for a student
of overcoming to reflect on their past or reflect on what they
have gone through - reflect on their addictions.
<p>
So, serving in the function as a teacher or even if these students
serve in a function as a teacher for you in the future, they don't
want to know your past. They want to know <em>nothing</em> of what
indulgences you have had. And they will encourage you to not
only put it behind you, but to make a point to erase it, forget
it. If you believe them when they say, "Don't identify with
it any longer. It is not you. I don't want to know of it,"
then why should <em>you</em> want to know of it? I mean if my Older
Member, my Heavenly Father, my Older Member's Older Member says,
"I don't want to know of it! It's not me. If you want
to identify with it, then for the time you are identifying with
it, you're knocking Me out of the picture," then why would
I want to cling to it? Even now I feel that we haven't adequately
covered this, and I hope that we can come back to it.
<p>
In the early manuscripts of religious material the names of members
of our Father's Kingdom were secret. They were unspeakable. 
They were just identifying positions that only they knew and understood
because they did not want to have names. It's also associated
with what we will talk further about as <em>crew members</em>, because
when we are a crew member, we don't want to be unique. We don't
want to have or need special attention or need special scheduling.
We want to only be a cog in the wheel. When I say <em>only</em>
- a cog in the wheel is a <em>very significant item</em> when you're
in our Father's Kingdom serving as a member of a crew. But I'm
afraid that I would be suspicious of anyone that would come and
say, "I am Jesus, here I am." And Jesus <em>warned</em>
them of that. He said, "Don't believe it if anybody says
that they are me." That should make us recognize, oops,
He's not going to come identifying Himself as that individual.
He's going to come as He tried to do before - identifying
only as a vessel, or not identifying at all, but merely <em>being</em>
a vessel, and therefore only His Father is speaking. Only His
Father can speak those things that are true, and would represent
His Father's experiences.
<p>
Now that doesn't mean we need to ignore all that Jesus experienced,
because much if not most of what Jesus said and Jesus experienced
was His Father speaking. Let's say, for example, if Jesus made
reference to being the son of Mary and Joseph, or "this is
my mother," was that the mother of His Father? Was Mary
the mother of His Father? No, Mary wasn't the mother of His Father.
So, for the moment He made that reference, it was a vehicular
reference, it was not His Father speaking. Therefore, He was,
for that moment, less than a vessel. I'm not criticizing Him.
I do that <em>more</em> than He did it, I would imagine, and I
am learning. Look at what just happened to us, we just simply
had this lesson within the past 24 hours. It was only this morning
that this lesson was clarified to me so much. Ultimately, if
I have your eye at any point on this vessel, even identifying
with Do, then I am not succeeding at becoming a pure vessel. 
The test of whether or not I am able to be used as a vessel, or
if my Father is being able to use me as a vessel, is if something
is coming in or coming through, or behavior is happening that
is not the same as could be applied to my Older Member or my Older
Member's Older Member or our Heavenly Father, or on up the line.
<p>
This is a lesson we can't think enough about. It's so valuable
to us because it's the key that opens the door to what is potentially
ahead for us as an avenue in returning to our Father's House to
become sons, to become servants. Because sons in our Father's
House are not into, "I'm Tom, I'm Jim, I'm somebody else."
We're not that. That repulsed me a little bit what I just did,
because if I'm ever sillier than or if my mannerisms set me apart
and they're separate and they are not what my Older Member would
do, then I am being less than a vessel. I am cluttering the information
that could come through for your sake and for my sake.
<p>
<em>Identity</em>...The closer we get to a significant position in our
Father's Kingdom, the more enlarged or magnified the danger is
in the slightest degree of separateness. That's what happened
to the soul that was in our Father's Kingdom that was called Lucifer.
He still had separate identity. Now, I can remember that the
information had been given to Ti previously that the standard
in our Father's House is being raised (I can speak of this as
history, of coming through Ti, because it was our Father speaking
through Ti when Ti said this - I feel that it was). Because
of the Luciferian experience, or because of that Son going awry
as he did, the standard is being raised. It's being made more
difficult to get into our Father's House. It's being made more
difficult to be a good crew member - less likely, less able
to go astray.
<p>
There's so much that I can't understand from where I sit, because
even playing the role of teacher and a vessel with students and
potentially with more students, relatively very little information
is funneled through that Teacher role. Because only the information
that is funneled can be helpful. Any information that seems to
come through that can't be helpful in the overcoming process might
have earmarks of being separate or unnecessary information, and
I don't feel that our Father's Kingdom sends unnecessary information.
That's what happens when questions come up that have relatively
no significance, no real relationship to our overcoming. We can
get into theorizing about things that might go on in the heavens
that really have nothing to do with our overcoming. And we can
play the game of exploring a little bit, but it opens the door
to possibly listening to other voices or letting <em>self </em>come
in, and/or playing the game of "what if" or guessing
what it might be. I know that at times we, Ti and I, have guessed.
When we do guess at questions that the students might ask, we
try to say, "We don't know. We're guessing.
It hasn't been clarified to us." And ultimately,
after discussing it for a moment, we usually say, "We feel
like it really isn't important<strong>;</strong> it's of no issue here to your
overcoming." What is shared is so limited - we know
so little of that Kingdom.
<p>
But what's interesting here is another question that I know is
on their list and I'll mess up their order of questions a little
bit by going into it, but it's the question of <em>faith vs. proof</em>.
Scientists frequently in this human world say, "I will believe
what I see. I have to see it to believe it. I can't accept this
religious concept of believing something on faith or just because
it's some legendary concept or religious concept. I believe what
I see." And yet, how many times have the astronomers rewritten
their history books because they thought they had seen things
that meant so and so were the facts and only to later find out
that what they had seen <em>didn't</em> mean that, it meant something
else. And then later to only understand that even that was off,
and have to continually rewrite their books, even though they
are the ones that say, "I believe what I see." You
don't know what you see when you see it. We can all misjudge
what we see. We think we know when we see something.
<p>
Now, <em>faith</em> is an interesting thing. We discussed a little
bit before the session began, of this question of faith and proof,
and I asked, "What are those scriptures that people refer
to in that faith hypothesis or thought"? And the student
said, "<em>Faith</em> is the evidence of things unseen,"
and went on to say something more. And then another one on that
same topic said, what was it?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, I thought it was, "Faith cometh by hearing
and hearing by the word." Is that it?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> The word of God. That's right. Okay, let's discuss that
a moment. <em>Faith is evidence of things unseen</em>. We can
stop right there. <em>Evidence</em>. Evidence sounds like something
that humans use in the courtroom as proof, a significant enough
proof that if there's enough evidence, then someone can say, "That's
the fact. It merits a verdict of guilty," or whatever it
is, based on <em>evidence</em>. As we relate to the Kingdom of
Heaven, they don't let us know about them on the basis of what
they show us, even though what we see and what they do show us
(if we can in our own thinking give them credit for it), we see
evidence of their magnificent plan in their design. I can't imagine
that any human surgeon who has dissected the human body could
think that that could just be a happenstance of nature. Nature?
I mean, where is the proof in what nature came from? Just a
happenstance in evolution of what? That doesn't make sense. 
And I'm not saying that our Father's Creation doesn't also have
certain aspects of evolving. But we do have evidence of things
that certainly seem to have some relationship to minds beyond
the human concept. It's pretty obvious that humans didn't create
humans at their beginning, that it had to be a result of something.
And to think that they were a result of a "big bang"
or some "happenstance" is pretty far-fetched. Even
though I can imagine that if there was a bang, then it was because
the Creator did a bang, and knew at that bang exactly how to have
it all end up with the evidence of things that we could actually
see. But as we try to get closer to our Father's Kingdom, the
funny thing is, He seems to have designed it so that we have to
get there more on a basis of <em>faith</em>.
<p>
Now, if <em>faith</em> is evidence of things unseen, a good example
of that would be<strong>:</strong> as we are fed information concerning the workings
of the Kingdom of Heaven and the workings of overcoming, the more
that picture grows and grows and grows, and begins to just <em>amaze</em>
us and <em>astound</em> us, because these intricate pieces of the
puzzle begin to fit together in that picture, and soon that picture
is so magnificent, so beyond anything we could have <em>dreamed</em>
of, that it is <em>evidence</em> of things unseen. Therefore, it
is proof to us. We don't need to base proof on what we can see,
and the reverse occurs. Let's say that in our Father's Kingdom
they also might use pieces of transportation that we might call
spacecrafts, or advanced forms of spacecrafts, that certainly
humans wouldn't have the capacity to build or use. And a human
might have witnessed seeing that spacecraft and say, "I saw
that," but he wouldn't necessarily know what he saw or what
the source of it was. And yet within our classroom, and certainly
this teacher sitting here can say honestly, "I don't remember
seeing a spacecraft that clearly, even though there's something
in the remembrance of it there and so much information has been
shared with me that I seem to know, beyond a doubt, that in our
Father's Kingdom they use physical means of transportation in
those spacecrafts." I guess what I'm saying is that we seem
to know more about the reality of something we haven't seen than
someone who has seen it. So, the basis of faith works.
<p>
Also another way of looking at that same issue is that you can't
get closer to our Father on the basis of what you have seen. 
Our Father does not give you proof. I don't remember what session
we discussed this on or if we've discussed it before, because
now I could easily be confused since we're replacing Sessions
7 and 8 and doing them again. But we discussed at one point how
an Evangelist had said, "If Jesus did not literally, symptomatically
reach death that could be diagnosed as that by any living physician
today, that He <em>died</em> on the cross and He was in that tomb,
He was <em>dead</em> and He <em>rose</em> literally from the dead,
and He moved and He was alive - if that did not <em>happen</em>
then all that Jesus said was a farce." And we said, "That's
ridiculous." That all information that we have says, "that's
ridiculous," and that it has very little bearing on what
Jesus had to say. Does it matter if Jesus even staged that event
to try to symbolize overcoming death, or that when the vehicle
dies, death is not reached, trying to help people understand.
I'm not saying that that's what happened. I doubt that that's
what happened. I don't care what happened. But I do know one
thing, that it does not matter to us. It does not matter to my
Father<strong>;</strong> it does not matter to the Kingdom of Heaven. We certainly
wouldn't base whether or not we believed what Jesus had to say,
what He taught, on whether or not He, in reality, could be diagnosed
as dead and then diagnosed as living. It doesn't make anything
that He had to say prior to that less true. We <em>know</em> that
everything He said <em>was</em> true. That everything that His
Father said through Him was clearly describing the Kingdom of
Heaven and how to overcome humanness. 'If you're going to be
My disciple'...and 'you can't even be my disciple if you don't even
leave your whole life behind. I mean <em>leave it</em>, I mean
<em>give it up</em>.'
<p>
We're back to where we were talking a few moments ago - about
<em>identity</em>. If I have truly given it up, then I am not that
anymore. Because as I came into His House, or I came into my
Father's house through Jesus, then the slate was wiped clean.
If it was really clean, it's nonexistent. And I will bring it
back and I'll have to wipe it clean again if I refer to my vehicle's
past. I'll have to ask for forgiveness all over again. 
I've re-instigated something that I said I was no more, that I
acknowledged was not in my Father's thinking, and I asked to be
cleansed, and was cleansed, and then I insisted on bringing the
dirt back into the tray again and presenting it again. Now, the
same is true right now, and we've just been reminded of it, that
<em>identity</em> stands between us and our Heavenly Father's
Kingdom. If, ideally, in our Heavenly Father's Kingdom all those
members are like branches off of a vine or off of a trunk and leaves
off of branches, then all of those leaves and all of those branches
emanate from the Source - not only emanate from the Source but are
that Source speaking.
<p>
We can clearly see that possibly the further a leaf is from the
point of origin of life at the trunk, that that leaf might have
less function as a vessel than a leaf that's closer or a branch
that's closer. That certainly would be true if we are newcomers
into our Father's Kingdom and we're going onto a family tree that's
different from the family tree in the human kingdom, and we are
simply a leaf and we are at some distance from, not only the trunk,
but the beginning of the trunk - we can't even understand the
beginning of the trunk. To try to understand, for a human to
ask, "Well, who created God"? is as appropriate and
as intelligent a question as for a dog to be able to verbalize,
"Who created man"? If you told the dog who created
man, could he comprehend it? He certainly couldn't comprehend
it. And if the Creator told us of His beginning...? There probably
isn't even a concept at the beginning that could be labeled a
beginning. The concept of beginning probably was only an applicable
term at the beginning within the range of comprehension of our
own beginning as potential children to return to His household
- servants, to return to His household. Therefore, we're going
to be babes in His household, brand new leaves. Those leaves
are going to be just as physical as they are in the human kingdom,
but different biology, different molecular structure, different
capacity, different mind, different <em>behavior</em>. Many aspects
of behavior that happen in the human kingdom, mainly because of
what the human kingdom has become, aren't even available to happen
there. That's why these things are inappropriate, because if
they aren't done there and we recall them or we're thinking of
them, then we're pulling ourselves back into a past that does
not exist in our Father's Kingdom.
<p>
So really, as we move into that Kingdom, we have to more and
more whack away at totally severing from the past. Now if we
really sever from, there is no "memory" of that past,
so then we live only in the present of where we find ourselves
in His Kingdom - babies, with a whole new World. We've destroyed
the past. I mean, wouldn't it be appropriate at a new kingdom
level?
<p>
Let's play the scenario that maybe even upon entering the human
kingdom (I'm not saying this is true, but the scenario works),
that a spirit might have come from a less-than-human kingdom as
it entered. But wouldn't it be true that when that spirit reached
the condition we would identify as the human kingdom, it then
would have - if it was going to function in that kingdom
- no recollection of anything prior to that? That would be its
beginning. It would be a fresh beginning. It would be a babe
in that Kingdom, or fresh beginning.
<p>
Now, the spirit can observe the animal kingdom, and if it wants
to, it can go backward (if this scenario were true) and try to
behave as an animal, even in pitiful ways that animals might behave
that would even be beneath most human's concept of how a human
at its lowest point should behave. The point is made here that
when we enter that Kingdom, if we do it according to instruction,
we're going to have a <em>clean slate</em>. Our past is gone. 
We've got to believe Him when He said, 'You lay it on me, I'll
wipe it out.' In other words, we don't believe Him if we don't
wipe the past out. He <em>wants</em> to wipe the past out. So,
if we insist on hanging onto the past, who's responsible? Can
we say, "Well you didn't wipe it out. You said you were
going to." He says, "As far as I'm concerned, it's
wiped out, I've <em>forgotten</em> it. I don't want to know your
past." So, if you want to remember it, if <em>you</em> want
to cling to it, that's your problem. Okay, let's proceed. What's
next on our list?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> Well, did you want to talk more about the Essenes?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> Yes. I asked the students to bring them up because I remembered
in a previous session a mention of Essenes. And I think the only
reference that was made to the Essenes was in the context of relating
that some modern Essene group (that I'm afraid that I can't even
put in the category of the real Essenes) said, or I had heard
or read that they had participated in stimulating their sensuality
or their sexuality, as some Eastern religions teach, in order
to come into enlightenment or to have the <em>kundalini</em> turned
on, or the "flame of knowledge," or whatever, which
is an abomination! It's a counterfeit. I think we discussed
it's a poor counterfeit or a facsimile of how when you have overcome
your physical or reproductive nature altogether and it's behind
you and you don't relate to it, then you're no longer drunk by
that drug and you can perceive information that comes to you,
and much higher knowledge, and therefore you can reach up to it.
<p>
But back to the Essenes. The reason we are re-discussing this
is because the application that is more appropriate for that term
"Essene" can be used as we relate to hidden groups that
existed in the Middle East in Biblical times. More particularly,
there was a group of Essenes that supposedly resided in the area
of Qumran, where the Dead Sea Scrolls came from. They were
(as far as a group is concerned that might be existing between
times that our Father's Kingdom comes in an incarnate condition)
trying as hard as any group on the face of the Earth to become
pure and to rid themselves of their human nature and to try to
get closer to the Kingdom of God. The Essene group that I'm referring
to is an esoteric group of Orthodox Judaism. There have been
books written that Jesus spent His unknown years, or some of his
early years before his ministry with that Essene group. And whether
that is true or not, it's of no significance to us. The possibility
exists that that could have been used as a stepping stone. But
my point in bringing it back is because I wanted to correct what
I had said and not have you think that we think poorly of that
group. As far as groups of believers and efforts of discipline
within the human kingdom exist, we'd have a hard time finding
a group that would be working harder at trying to be pure and
to overcome aspects of this world, and to be more ready. And
as far as I'm concerned, if souls are cycled back into the human
kingdom at the appropriate time that members of our Father's Kingdom
are there, maybe you at the other end of that camera were in that
Essene community at one time. Maybe you were with Jesus at one
time. If you know His Heavenly Father, you know my Heavenly Father.
You know the same knowledge He gives to me to share with you,
or, that He uses my instrument to express to you. And our purpose
for being here is to serve those that have returned in order to
complete their overcoming, to do the last little polishing up
of areas that maybe are still awry and need some correction, and
present them to our Father's Kingdom.
Where the human kingdom was wiped out, <em>obliterated</em>, they
could start fresh - clean plants ready to serve in a new agenda
as crew members that functioned only with the tasks that are of
the concern of our Heavenly Father's Kingdom.
<p>
Excuse me, what's next on our list of questions?
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> How do I identify which God I am praying to?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> This is an issue we need to discuss. You say, "There
is only one God." And yes, that's true. But believe it
or not, there are other individuals who say, "I'm God,"
just as we've discussed that there are some individuals who would
say, "I'm Jesus." Does it not make sense that the camp
in opposition to our Father's House would spend most of their
effort trying to rob those souls that know that their rightful
heritage is through the Judeo-Christian heritage? And there Luci's
camp would say, "This is where we need to work if we're going
to keep those souls from getting into that corporation that really
is not aware of the reality of <em>cosmic consciousness</em> and
<em>universal mind</em>. They're more aware of just becoming vessels,
and just being a part of a vine, and not really having the opportunity
to develop and become rightful 'gods' of their own." That
vernacular gets kind of mixed up and kind of crazy and dangerous.
So, how do we test in our prayers and in our meditation who we're
praying to?
<p>
There are some prayers that might be appropriate for those who
are not in the position that some of you might find yourself in,
or that these in this classroom might be in. Because once you're
in the possible condition of wanting to make a transition from
the human kingdom to our Heavenly Father's Kingdom, at that point
our Father expects you to be in a position of saying, "Your
will, not mine" about <em>everything</em> - and of saying,
"I only want to be an instrument of Your desire. I only
want to serve in the function that is of Your concern. I want
to overcome everything that is of <em>my</em> concern or anything
that is separate." Someone in the human kingdom who has
not reached that condition yet, might sincerely pray to our Father's
Kingdom, unaware that someone outside of our Father's Kingdom
might jump in and answer their prayers, particularly if they are
praying for something that is of the human kingdom - praying that
their mortgage might be met, or that they have more money so they
can get a Buick instead of a Plymouth, or they can get a Cadillac
next time instead of a Ford, or whatever the values are. But
if their eyes are upon their physical needs rather than saying,
"You know what our needs are, but I know that I need to ask
You to supply our needs, then I need to examine if I think they
<em>aren't</em> supplied when I've asked you - then I must have
a misconception of what our needs are. We need to re-examine
what our needs are, because You do take care of our needs."
<p>
I'm afraid that Lucifer has control of so many of those so-called
leaders in the Christian world today and wants to get the rightful
heirs of our Father's sonship, of our Father's Kingdom, off the
track. He would certainly turn their eyes if he stands half a
chance. And one way he can do it is to say, "Our Father's
Kingdom wants you to have fine things and have wealth and have
all of the physical benefits. He wants you to live a good life.
He doesn't want you buying into this<strong>:</strong> 'you must be in sack cloth.'"
A lot of that's true. But don't forget that Luci is so close
to the truth in the things of his counterfeit. I mean, they are
almost believable. You'll have to look at them under a microscope
to discover that they're counterfeit. But Luci's camp would have
those people try to tell the Christians who are trying to get
closer to their Heavenly Father that, "ask for your financial
needs and He will supply them." You don't know that He'll
supply them. Who are you to say, "Ask Him for your financial
needs"? He said ask in the way that you're saying, "Thy
will, not my will, You know my needs, and if I'm looking to You,
I must trust that You will supply my needs if I'm looking to You."
So, it's a dangerous proposition. 
<p>
Where were we? Remind me of the question again.
<p>
Student<strong>:</strong> How do I identify which God that I am praying to?
<p>
Do<strong>:</strong> We may have pretty well covered the question, but it wouldn't
hurt to spend another minute on it. As far as I'm concerned,
I'm in a position that has been commissioned as a teacher, to
serve as a vessel, as a teacher for those designed to get into
our Father's Kingdom. So, I can't really speak with much clarity
or authority as to what others should be doing who are not interested
in getting from here to there. But, if you're interested in getting
from here to there now, in this lifetime, in the next few months,
between now and the end of this Age (and we don't know if that's
going to happen within the next year or when it's going to happen),
if that is your concern then, as it is our concern, of getting
back into His House, literally and physically....
<p>
We don't anticipate that we are going to lose these vehicles
- though we know that if we lost them and our slate is clean, and
we have overcome the world, we've lost nothing. We could still
go to wardrobe in our Father's Kingdom and get a nice new suit
that didn't even have that old kind of plumbing, and didn't even
have those characteristics that were still going to have to fade
away. So, does it really matter if we take this vehicle into
that Kingdom, because they come and we are in their midst wherever
that is - whether they are here or we are there doesn't matter.
But if we are leaving the human kingdom and entering our Father's
Kingdom, in a sense, our Father's Kingdom (or Heaven) is wherever
our Father is and <em>Representatives</em> of His Kingdom are.
<p>
Where our Father is, and <em>Representatives</em> of His Kingdom,
I'm afraid could also mean we would see the physical characteristics
of their presence. We would see vehicles unlike human vehicles,
except still the same image - that have arms and legs and
stand erect and have beautiful countenances. We don't know exactly
the particulars, but we know that they would be in a vehicle that
was for all intents and purposes indestructible, even though it
could be lost and it could be replaced easily. But whether or
not we take this vehicle into that Kingdom and they put us in
their lab and they zap it and it's changed over to one of theirs
in the twinkling of an eye, or if we lose this one before they
come and do that, and we get one out of wardrobe, it's the same
difference. What's important is<strong>:</strong> how fast have I overcome the
world so that I don't need to return to the human world. Therefore,
I am in a position, if my slate is sufficiently clean as they
judge it, that I don't need to return.
I'm in line for one of their vehicles whether I get this one
changed over in a laboratory or whether I lose it right before
their laboratory comes and they pull one out of their wardrobe
that they have prepared for me and has my name on it, because
it jives exactly with my station of growth. Don't
confuse the issue of a name as identity in that place, because
from their point of view, it's merely labeled to get a match,
so that it would work for me.
<p>
You can be in the same mindset that we're in - that we anticipate
entering our Father's Kingdom soon. We feel that what has been
shared with us can shorten the days of the elect. If you have
come here from our Father's Kingdom to finish your overcoming,
then you know what we're saying is true, and you'll be waiting
and craving to go full throttle in finishing that off, knowing
that there is a short time in which to do it. Because of the
time that we have had in preparing our lab and preparing our heads
in our own overcoming, and because of what we have learned, the
picture is so clear and it is so big to us and so much has been
shared with us. Because in the time that we were doing it, it
was a slow process, getting one item at a time. But now we see
those items and we can see them clearly, and we can share them
with you. Therefore, the Next Level through us sharing them with
you, can shorten your days to such a brief span, in that sense,
for the elect their days are shortened.
<p>
The "elect" would mean that you have been picked to
finish your overcoming. You could say, "Oh boy, I placed
such a 'high falootin' interpretation of what the elect is, how
could I be one of the elect"? Well, if the Next Level picks
you, don't question it. Let them be the ones responsible for
that. I mean, look what they've picked. We can't take the credit
for anything in our own overcoming. They've given it to us. 
They've fed it to us. If they hadn't fed it to us a step at a
time, we couldn't have done anything. <em>They</em> did it. They
gave us the ingredients, by our asking and by their choice of
giving, so that we could be recipients of overcoming. So, if
you are one that is prepared for overcoming, then you are as lucky
as we are lucky and can receive their gift, and we want to serve
in that way. We certainly don't want to interfere, and we were
learning that we could interfere by turning on something that
could cause you delay in that process. I'm so thankful that it
was shared with us so that we can avoid sharing certain experiences
we have had that might delay your overcoming process. If anything,
we're just as concerned with your days being shortened as you
are, because we're so eager for this task of ours to reach completion.
It becomes fearful for us to think of the time that it might
take, but we're not going to listen to that fear.
<p>
There's that 10-second card and we're at the end of this session.
We hope that Ti has spoken through us.
