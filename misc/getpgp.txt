WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP) FAQ

Revised 28 September 1996

Disclaimer -- I haven't recently verified all of the information in
this file, and much of it is probably out of date.

For questions not covered here, please read the documentation
that comes with PGP, get one of the books mentioned below, or search for
other relevant FAQ documents at rtfm.mit.edu and on the 
alt.security.pgp
comp.security.pgp
comp.security.pgp.ressources
news group.


A NOTE FROM THE FAQ MAINTAINERS

Peter Herngaard <pethern@datashopper.dk> is taking over the maintenance
of this FAQ until further notice.

Some of you sent me (Mike Johnson) corrections and suggestions for
this FAQ, and I stored them away on my hard disk to edit from. Then,
Windows 95 got indigestion (induced by a sound card) and destroyed
all of the data in that partition. If you suggested changes and they
aren't in this FAQ, please send them to Peter Herngaard
<pethern@datashopper.dk>.


WHAT IS THE LATEST VERSION OF PGP?

WHERE CAN I FTP PGP IN NORTH AMERICA?

If you are in the USA or Canada, you can get PGP by following the
instructions in any of:

ftp://net-dist.mit.edu/pub/PGP/README
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README.MPJ
ftp://miyako.dorm.duke.edu/pub/GETTING_ACCESS
ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/pgp/
ftp://ftp.gibbon.com/pub/pgp/README.PGP
ftp://ftp.wimsey.bc.ca/pub/crypto/software/README

WHERE IS PGP ON COMPUSERVE?

GO NCSAFORUM. Follow the instructions there to gain access to Library 12:
Export Controlled.

AOL

Go to the AOL software library and search "PGP" or ftp from
ftp://ftp.csua.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/pgp or another site listed above.
It is possible to get PGP from ftp sites with hidden directories with the
following trick:  (1) View the README file with the hidden directory name in
it, then quickly (2) Start a new ftp connection, specifiying the hidden
directory name with the ftp site's address, like
ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_xxxxxxx (where the xxxxxxx is
replaced with the current character string).

IS PGP LEGAL?

Pretty Good Privacy is legal if you follow these rules:

Don't export PGP from the USA except to Canada, or from Canada except to the
USA, without a license.
If you are in the USA, use either Viacrypt PGP (licensed for commercial use)
or MIT PGP using RSAREF (limited to personal, noncommercial use). Outside of
the USA, where RSA is not patented, you may prefer to use a version of PGP
(2.6.3i) that doesn't use RSAREF to avoid the restrictions of that license.

If you are in a country where the IDEA cipher patent holds in
software (including the USA and some countries in Europe), make
sure you are licensed to use the IDEA cipher commercially before using
PGP commercially. (No separate license is required to use the freeware
PGP for personal, noncommercial use). For direct IDEA licensing, contact
Ascom Systec:

Erhard Widmer,  Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMVV      Phone  +41 64 56 59 83
Peter Hartmann, Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMN       Phone  +41 64 56 59 45
Fax:            +41 64 56 59 90
e-mail:         IDEA@ascom.ch
Mail address:   Gewerbepark, CH-5506 Maegenwil (Switzerland)

Viacrypt has an exclusive marketing agreement for commercial
distribution of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted code. (Selling
shareware/freeware disks or connect time is OK). This restriction does
not apply to PGP 3.0, since it is a complete rewrite by Colin Plumb.

If you modify PGP (other than porting it to another platform, fixing a bug,
or adapting it to another compiler), don't call it PGP (TM) or Pretty Good
Privacy (TM) without Philip Zimmermann's permission.
IMPORTANT:
Please note that there is an official distribution site for MIT
PGP and another for the International version:
WorldWideWeb references:
U.S/Canada non-commercial use: http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp-form.html
Norway/International non-commercial use: http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/
U.S. commercial use: http://www.viacrypt.com

WHAT IS PHILIP ZIMMERMANN'S LEGAL STATUS?

Philip Zimmermann was under investigation for alleged violation of export
regulations, with a grand jury hearing evidence for about 28 months, ending
11 January 1996. The Federal Government chose not to comment on why it
decided to not prosecute, nor is it likely to.  The Commerce Secretary stated
that he would seek relaxed export controls for cryptographic products, since
studies show that U. S. industry is being harmed by current regulations.
Philip endured some serious threats to his livelihood and freedom, as well as
some very real legal expenses, for the sake of your right to electronic
privacy.  The battle is won, but the war is not over. The regulations that
caused him so much grief and which continue to dampen cryptographic
development, harm U. S. industry, and do violence to the U. S. National
Security by eroding the First Ammendment of the U. S. Constitution and
encouraging migration of cryptographic industry outside of the U. S. A. are
still on the books.  If you are a U. S. Citizen, please write to your U. S.
Senators, Congressional Representative, President, and Vice President
pleading for a more sane and fair cryptographic policy.

WHAT OTHER FILE ENCRYPTION (DOS, MAC) TOOLS ARE THERE?

PGP can do conventional encryption only of a file (-c) option, but
you might want to investigate some of the other alternatives if you do
this a lot. Alternatives include Quicrypt and Atbash2 for DOS, DLOCK for
DOS & UNIX, Curve Encrypt (for the Mac), HPACK (many platforms), and a
few others.

Quicrypt is interesting in that it comes in two flavors:  shareware
exportable and registered secure. Atbash2 is interesting in that it generates
ciphertext that can be read over the telephone or sent by Morse code. DLOCK
is a no-frills strong encryption program with complete source code. Curve
Encrypt has certain user-friendliness advantages. HPACK is an archiver (like
ZIP or ARC), but with strong encryption. A couple of starting points for your
search are:

International availability:

ftp://idea.sec.dsi.unimi.it/pub/crypt/code/
HOW DO I SECURELY DELETE FILES (DOS)?

If you have the Norton Utilities, Norton WipeInfo is pretty good. I
use DELETE.EXE in del110.zip, which is really good at deleting existing
files, but doesn't wipe "unused" space.

WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE PASS PHRASE IN MY WINDOWS SWAP FILE?

The nature of Windows is that it can swap any memory to disk at any
time, meaning that all kinds of interesting things could end up in your
swap file.

WHERE DO I GET PGPfone(tm)?

PGPfone is in beta test for Macintosh and Windows'9 users.
The MIT has shut down their ftp distribution of PGPfone <tm> for
Macintosh and Windows'95, so within the U.S/Canada you must obtain
PGPfone <tm> using a WorldWideWeb browser.

U.S. only availability:

WHERE DO I GET NAUTILUS?

Bill Dorsey, Pat Mullarky, and Paul Rubin have come out with a
program called Nautilus that enables you to engage in secure voice
conversations between people with multimedia PCs and modems capable of
at least 7200 bps (but 14.4 kbps is better). See:

HOW DO I ENCRYPT MY DISK ON-THE-FLY?

Secure File System (SFS) is a DOS device driver that encrypts an entire
partition on the fly using SHA in feedback mode.

Secure Drive also encrypts an entire DOS partition, using IDEA, which is
patented.

Secure Device is a DOS device driver that encrypts a virtual, file-hosted
volume with IDEA.

Cryptographic File System (CFS) is a Unix device driver that uses DES.
CryptDisk is a ShareWare package for Macintosh that uses strong IDEA
encryption like PGP.

WHERE IS PGP'S COMPETITION?

RIPEM is the second most popular freeware email encryption package.  I like
PGP better for lots of reasons, but if for some reason you want to check or
generate a PEM signature, RIPEM is available at ripem.msu.edu. There is also
an exportable RIPEM/SIG.

HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?

Send mail to one of these addresses with the single word "help" in the
subject line to find out how to use them. These servers sychronize keys with
each other.  There are other key servers, too.

pgp-public-keys@keys.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys@keys.de.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys@keys.no.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys@keys.uk.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys@keys.us.pgp.net

WWW interface to the key servers: http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-toplev.html

For US $20/year or so, you can have your key officially certified and
published in a "clean" key database that is much less susceptible to
denial-of-service attacks than the other key servers. Send mail to
info-pgp@Four11.com for information, or look at http://www.Four11.com/

Of course, you can always send your key directly to the parties you wish to
correspond with by whatever means you wish.
